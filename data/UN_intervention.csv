Indeed, as we consider the reform of the Security Council, why do we not concentrate more on its deeper action, with a view to giving it the means to accomplish preventative diplomacy, as we consider its size and structure?

12,1957,ARG,"The Soviet delegation has submitted a draft declaration [A/3673] whereby the General Assembly would call upon all States to base their mutual relations upon the following principles: ""mutual respect for one another's territorial integrity and sovereignty; non-aggression; non-intervention in one another’s domestic affairs on any economic, political or ideological grounds whatsoever; equality and mutual benefit; and peaceful coexistence."
12,1957,POL,"The principles of peaceful coexistence contained in the declarations of China and India, in other bilateral declarations, and then proclaimed at the historic Bandung Conference, have become crystallized generally in recommendations for mutual respect for territorial integrity, national sovereignty, non-aggression, non-intervention in the internal affairs of States, equality and peaceful coexistence."
12,1957,SDN,"Our position on this question was dictated not by opportunism or animosity towards any country, but by our sincere belief that armed intervention, or any other intervention for that matter, in the domestic affairs of an independent and sovereign State should not be accepted among the principles that govern relationships between independent and sovereign States, irrespective of the reasons which might have led to this state of affairs."
12,1957,NPL,"Whatever might have been the criticisms, the intervention of the United Nations through an emergency force in November 1956 certainly brought about the acceptance of a cease-fire and the subsequent withdrawal of the Anglo-French and Israel forces from Egyptian territory."
12,1957,NPL,"To those who were inclined from the beginning to believe that the Assembly's action on Hungary would be altogether futile, may I pose a simple and direct question: If the Assembly had passed over in silence the intolerable situation that occurred in Hungary last fall as a result of foreign armed intervention, would it have redounded to the credit of the United Nations in any way? Would such a course of action have better served the cause of peace, humanity and the freedom of smaller nations? In my opinion, such an attitude of timidity or inaction on the part of the United Nations would have seriously damaged its reputation as an organization pledged primarily to secure the freedom and rights of every Member nation."
12,1957,NPL,"We do not approve of foreign interference in the affairs of any nation, let alone armed intervention."
12,1957,DOM,"The Dominican Republic supported the decisions taken by the United Nations in the case of Hungary because it considered that its abstention would imply a lack of respect towards its own history, for while any intervention in the domestic affairs of a State is to be condemned as an international crime, it is most repugnant when it takes the form of military intervention, accompanied by the most inhuman treatment of a people which has struggled to establish a new order in keeping with the upsurge of nationalism throughout the world."
12,1957,LAO,"In other words, coexistence can be conceived only within the framework of Independence and non-intervention."
12,1957,LAO,"One ill-considered act of intervention is sufficient to bring to nothing years of effort, solidarity, mutual aid and understanding."
12,1957,LAO,This spirit of non-intervention and understanding will be essential if we are to solve one of the major difficulties of our national political life.
12,1957,LAO,"Peaceful coexistence and harmony cannot, as I said earlier, be conceived except within the framework of mutual respect for territorial integrity and independence, Passive acceptance of foreign intervention would lead only to enslavement."
12,1957,BLR,"As in the past, the delegation of the Byelorussian SSR will resolutely oppose any efforts at United Nations intervention in the internal affairs of Hungary."
12,1957,BLR,"The draft contains an appeal to States to be guided in their relations with, one another by the following principles: mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, non-intervention in one another’s domestic affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence."
12,1957,BLR,"Dulles wished to intimidate the General Assembly by saying that the Eisenhower doctrine would be applied to Syria, that is that there would be armed intervention in the Middle East."
12,1957,SLV,"El Salvador, one of the founder Members of this Organization and also a founder member of important regional bodies such as the Organization of American States and the Organization of Central American States, has at all times distinguished itself by its spirit of solidarity and by its support of the great moral and legal principles on which the coexistence of nations is based — the principles of the juridical equality of States, the right of peoples to self-determination and the principle of non-intervention by one State in the affairs of another."
12,1957,URY,"My delegation was among those which voted in favour of his election to that high office, and it welcomed the wise intervention of the Secretary for External Relations of Mexico, Mr."
12,1957,URY,"In the first case - the war between Israel and Egypt and the subsequent armed intervention in the Suez Canal area - the General Assembly assumed its supplementary powers in the delicate matter of preserving the peace, as it had done in 1950 when faced with the aggression against the Republic of Korea."
12,1957,PAN,"Undoubtedly, the intervention of the United Nations in the Suez Canal conflict was an extraordinary triumph for our Organization."
12,1957,PAN,"Over and above agreement of a political nature, the Latin Americans respect the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States, but we protest when this argument is used as a pretext for subjugating defenceless peoples."
12,1957,UKR,"The draft declaration, as we know, sets forth five principles of peaceful coexistence, namely: mutual respect for one another's territorial integrity and sovereignty; non-aggression; non-intervention in one another's domestic affairs on any economic, political or ideological grounds whatsoever; equality and mutual benefit; and peaceful coexistence."
12,1957,CHN,"That regime had suddenly found itself deserted by the people, by its own army and its own police force, and was restored only by the intervention of Soviet troops."
12,1957,AUS,"These five principles are as follows: mutual respect for one another's territorial integrity and sovereignty; non-aggression; non-intervention in one another’s domestic affairs on any economic, political or ideological grounds whatsoever; equality and mutual benefit; and finally, peaceful coexistence."
12,1957,CHL,"Without the intervention of world organs, economic equilibrium cannot be achieved, and the United Nations cannot remain indifferent to a situation which vitally affects the welfare and development of many countries."
12,1957,CSK,"Under this doctrine, which was enacted into law, the Government of the United States announced a programme of intervention in the domestic affairs of the sovereign States in the Near and Middle East, a programme for a new colonial enslavement of the Arab peoples, the implementation of which implies the use of United States armed forces."
12,1957,CSK,"Under these proposals, the four great Powers - the USSR, the United States, the United Kingdom and France - would assume a solemn obligation to refrain from the use of force in the Near and Middle East and from intervention in the domestic affairs of the countries in this area."
12,1957,CSK,"The implementation of these principles calls for observance of the sovereignty and full equality of rights of States, mutual respect for territorial integrity, non-aggression and non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States."
12,1957,COL,"It would appear that a mere investigation of such a situation does not constitute the intervention so categorically prohibited by Article 2, paragraph 7, of the Charter."
12,1957,COL,"Similarly, the investigation and study of situations which may affect international peace does not constitute intervention."
12,1957,IRL,So we have been dealing with a diplomatic drawing-back by the major Powers from intervention in the affairs of nationally independent but weak countries.
12,1957,ISR,It was directly responsible for the crisis of last winter which in turn led to United Nations intervention.
12,1957,SYR,"This so-called stability, which is inimical to natural evolution, requires foreign intervention and explains the character of the means used for this purpose."
12,1957,SYR,Let us recall recent events in another part of the Arabian Peninsula resulting from the intervention of British armed forces in Oman.
12,1957,SYR,"In conformity with the very principles of the Charter, Syria is resisting and will continue to resist by all means in its power foreign intervention in its internal affairs, in the same way that it is resolutely determined not to intervene in the internal affairs of other countries."
12,1957,RUS,"With these States the Soviet Union has good, friendly relations on the sound basis of genuine mutual respect and strict non-intervention in each other’s domestic affairs."
12,1957,RUS,"It is proposed in this declaration that the General Assembly should call upon States to base their mutual relations on the following principles: ""(a) Mutual respect for one another’s territorial integrity and sovereignty; ""(b) Non-aggression; ""(c) Non-intervention in one another's domestic affairs on any economic, political or ideological grounds whatsoever; ""(d) Equality and mutual benefit; and ""(e) Peaceful coexistence."
12,1957,RUS,"In our opinion, it is the duty of the United Nations to put an end to foreign military intervention in the lives of the peoples of those countries and to protect their legitimate nationa1 rights."
12,1957,RUS,"Crude political and economic pressure is being applied to that country, plots are being hatched against its Government, and it is threatened more and more frequently of late with direct military intervention."
12,1957,RUS,"They see danger in the fact that the USSR is opposed to the subjection of the countries of the Near and Middle East to foreign dictation, that it is opposed to foreign intervention in the affairs of those States and that it is in favour of the development and strengthening of their independence."
12,1957,RUS,"They provide, in particular, that the Governments of the four Powers, the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the USSR, should renounce the use of force in the Near and Middle East and all intervention in the domestic affairs of the countries of that region."
12,1957,RUS,"I would ask you, what is wrong with these proposals? Why should we not declare our renunciation of the use of force and of intervention in the domestic affairs of the countries of that region? Nevertheless, the Governments of the United States, the United Kingdom and France have refused to accept those proposals."
12,1957,ETH,I have already had occasion to congratulate the President during my previous intervention [686th meeting].
12,1957,MEX,"To refer more specifically to the political activities of the Organization that are most frequently the object of criticism, how can we forget, for example the results of United Nations intervention in the questions of Indonesia and the former Italian colonies; the pacification of the frontiers of Greece; the Berlin dispute; the withdrawal of foreign forces from Syria, Lebanon and Iran in 1946 and from Burma in 1953 and following years; the question of Trieste and the Treaty of Peace with Austria; the independence of Morocco and Tunisia, and finally the very grave crisis which it had to face less than a year ago in the so-called Suez Canal question? 127."
12,1957,MEX,"Nevertheless, all of them as the direct or the indirect result of United Nations intervention, were satisfactorily solved and have disappeared from the map of world problems."
12,1957,MEX,"It considers fundamental the principle that, to use the words of the protocol signed by the American Republics in 1936, any intervention of a State ""directly or indirectly, and for whatever reason, in the internal or external affairs"" of any other State is inadmissible."
23,1968,BOL,"We witnessed, to our sorrow, the invasion of Czechoslovakia and the violation of the principles of sovereignty, non-intervention and self-determination of peoples."
23,1968,BOL,"In speaking of intervention, I cannot refrain from mentioning the case of my country, which, as everyone knows, has also been the victim of an aggression master-minded from outside and aimed at suppressing fundamental freedoms, obstructing the achievements of the people during years of tireless struggle and preventing their consolidation."
23,1968,BDI,Non-intervention in the domestic affairs of States is a principle that must remain inviolable.
23,1968,RUS,The reason for the division of Korea is the flagrant intervention by the United States of America in the internal affairs of the Korean people and the United States policy of turning South Korea into its own strategic strongpoint and a powerful military base directed against the security of the peoples of Asia.
23,1968,MYS,"It is a great pleasure for my delegation and my Government to offer to Mr, Arenales, in our first intervention in the general debate of this Assembly, our warmest felicitations on his unanimous election to the office of President."
23,1968,MYS,"But the fact remains that the Security Council, more often than not, turns away from its peace-keeping power unless the interest of one or other of the permanent members cries out for intervention."
23,1968,MYS,Malaysia deeply regrets the action taken in Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countries and views with deep concern the intervention of their troops in that country.
23,1968,MYS,"While reserving the right to make any further intervention that we consider necessary, I do not wish to add anything at this stage."
23,1968,LUX,The hope for a return to trust through a reduction of tension will be a vain hope so long as the occupation troops remain in Czechoslovakia and so long as the Soviet Union continues to bring the threat of intervention to bear on other countries as well.
23,1968,POL,"Let me recall our intervention in the general debate on 10 October 1966 [1434th meeting], when we gave a broad outline of a possible agenda for such a conference."
23,1968,SLV,"The international community is in a quandary because of its humane interest in the consequences of the conflict, the lack of broadly-recognized and accepted channels to express that interest, and the need scrupulously to respect the principle of non-intervention."
23,1968,SLV,My Government is distressed by the fact that the principle of non-intervention was violated in recent months with the occupation of Czechoslovakia.
23,1968,SLV,"The principle of non-intervention is as important today as it was in 1928 when, at the Sixth International Conference of American States, the Foreign Minister of El Salvador, Mr."
23,1968,SLV,"The defence of non-intervention is the defence of medium- and small-sized countries, and therefore in defending Czechoslovakia’s right to determine its own political destiny, we are defending the right and the interest of all medium- and small-sized States, without distinction of political régime or geographical location."
23,1968,SLV,"The line of defence of the principle of non-intervention extends through all continents and all periods in history, and at times has extended through the American continent; but in August of this year that line of defence ran through Prague."
23,1968,SLV,"We maintain our traditional policy in support of decolonization and condemn foreign intervention and overt or covert protectorates, as well as discrimination of all kinds."
23,1968,FRA,"It must be said: the vast majority of Europeans, of whatever nation and in the East as in the West, were shocked beyond words when they heard the news of the military intervention in Czechoslovakia by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and four Warsaw Pact nations."
23,1968,NGA,"References such as we have had to the so-called “tragedy of Biafra”, the so-called “martyrdom of the Ibo people"", and the suggestion founded on a patently erroneous construction of certain provisions of the Charter of this Organization that a solution must be found to our internal problem so as to give effect to certain imaginary rights, amount to a flagrant violation of the basic principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of Member States."
23,1968,NGA,"By urging the rebels to hold out in spite of the realities of the situation in the hope of gaining ultimate victory through world intervention, they have encouraged them to exploit human suffering for political advantage."
23,1968,JOR,"Nearly a year and a half has passed now since the creation of this abnormal situation, with little hope discernible for a gallant intervention by the world community to remove the aggression manifested in the military occupation of my country’s soil and to right the wrong that has been done."
23,1968,JOR,"Israel, however, has not left one opening for the sincere efforts of the United Nations and its representative, not one hope that it will change its intransigent mood of aggression, its fascination with military force and its resistance to any United Nations intervention on behalf of justice and peace in the region."
23,1968,THA,"Consequently, armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements are condemned."
23,1968,THA,"It is painful and disappointing to us that the Soviet Union, which is a founding Member of the United Nations and which took the initiative three years ago in inscribing on the agenda the item on non-intervention that subsequently resulted in the Declaration that I have just referred to, should decide in its own wisdom to stifle the United Nations Charter and the provisions in the Declaration which it helped to bring about."
23,1968,COD,"Foreign intervention in Czechoslovakia, the endless conflict in the Middle East and the murderous war in Viet-Nam have undoubtedly threatened and still threaten international security, but it is the relentless arms race, also, that provides the overwhelming climax of anxiety and horror."
23,1968,SWE,It was an infringement on the territorial integrity and the political independence of Czechoslovakia and it has led to intervention in the internal affairs of the country.
23,1968,NZL,"In any intervention, however, the United Nations must be prepared to grapple with all the involved and difficult aspects of this very complex issue."
23,1968,PHL,Naked force was applied against a Member of the United Nations by some of its own allies whose representatives have tirelessly championed the principle of peaceful coexistence and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States.
23,1968,NOR,This principle of non-intervention has been observed by all the Western nations.
23,1968,FIN,"And, finally, the intervention in Czechoslovakia, although it has been presented as a matter that concerns only the Socialist States of Eastern Europe, cannot but weaken confidence in such a development of international life as would preclude the use of force in relations among States."
23,1968,FIN,"If this trend is not reversed, and if the principle of non-intervention in the free destiny of nations is not re-established, the future of international peace and security itself is indeed a very dark one."
23,1968,SLE,My Government wishes to commend and pay tribute to the warrant officers and the rank and file of the Royal Sierra Leone military forces and the Sierra Leone police through whose valiant intervention a return to constitutional Government has been made possible.
23,1968,IRN,"It is our view that the armed intervention in Czechoslovakia, which has taken place without an appeal from the legal government of that country, is unjustifiable."
23,1968,IRN,"Only through a strict observance of the basic principles enshrined in the Charter — in particular, the pledge to refrain from the use of force and to refrain from intervention in the internal affairs of other States — can we ever hope to approach the establishment of the rule of law."
23,1968,YUG,"The continuation of the war in Viet-Nam, the crisis in the Middle East and the recent events in Europe — the armed intervention in Czechoslovakia and the occupation of that country — are all seed-beds of conflict which jeopardize the very foundations of international order."
23,1968,YUG,"Finally, as regards the situation in Europe, we consider that it is first of all necessary to eliminate the consequences of the intervention which has taken place in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic."
23,1968,LBR,We cannot overlook the fact that this problem has been due partly to unwarranted outside intervention in violation of the Charter.
23,1968,CAN,"Consequently, armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements, are condemned."
23,1968,CAN,We must also be aware of the danger to peace in Europe arising from recent charges levelled by the Soviet Union against the Federal Republic of Germany and the evocation of an alleged unilateral right of intervention in yet another country.
23,1968,LBN,"But it is hard to refrain from pointing out that United Nations intervention, which was the decisive factor in the birth of Israel, has lost some of its force and efficacy whenever there has been a question of putting a stop to its abuses."
23,1968,MEX,"Self-determination requires, in turn, the observance by all States — big, medium and small — of the principle of non-intervention, which was defined so clearly, and so consistently with the problems of our time, in the historic Declaration made by this Assembly in December 1965 [resolution 2131 (XX)]."
23,1968,DNK,"Since I come from a European country, it is only natural that I should be thinking especially of the military intervention in Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union and other members of the Warsaw Pact."
23,1968,DNK,The setback to détente suffered as a result of the intervention in Czechoslovakia has caused us disappointment and concern.
23,1968,CSK,"The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic has remained and continues to remain faithful to the principles of the United Nations Charter, namely the duty of States to co-operate with each other, the principle of the equal rights of peoples and their right to self-determination, the principle of the sovereign equality of States, the principle of respect for international commitments, the principle of non-intervention, the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes and the prohibition of the threat or use of force in international relations."
23,1968,MDG,"And he added:  “If this trend is not reversed, and if the principle of non-intervention in the free destiny of nations is not re-established, the future of the international peace and security itself is indeed a very dark one."
23,1968,MDG,We cannot understand intervention with apparently the main purpose of bringing journalists and artists to heel.
23,1968,UKR,"The main reason for the division of Korea is the gross intervention by the United States in the internal affairs of the Korean people, the United States policy of making South Korea a strategic springboard and a major military base aimed at the security of the peoples of Asia."
23,1968,YEM,"Despite the withdrawal, about a year ago, of the United Arab Republic forces whose presence in Yemen was taken by some reactionary Powers as a pretext for intervention in our internal affairs, the interventionists never gave up their interventions and dreams."
23,1968,YEM,"Nay, intervention has become more virulent and more open."
23,1968,YEM,"We had expected the United Nations to help our people in their striving for peace and security and to prevent external intervention in our internal affairs, as well as to give assistance in the task of reconstruction and development."
23,1968,HND,"He likewise warns us that, unless the principle of non-intervention in the self-determination of nations is re-established, the prospects for international peace and security will remain dim."
23,1968,HND,"We also share in the Secretary-General’s condemnation of the cruel intervention by the Soviet Union and four of its allies in invading Czechoslovakia on 21 August 1968, in flagrant violation of the principles of international law and the fundamental precepts of the Charter."
23,1968,HND,"As a Latin American country, we base our condemnation of the aggression against Czechoslovakia on our adherence to the principle of non-intervention as established within our own regional system and reaffirmed in the Charter and at several sessions of the General Assembly by the Latin American representatives collectively, and on our peoples’ repudiation of all acts that threaten the security and sovereign integrity of States."
23,1968,HND,"We therefore feel entitled to reject — here in our continent and in any other part of the world any intervention, and especially armed intervention, as an instrument of domination that jeopardizes the juridical equality of States and threatens to destroy the foundations of the United Nations just as the League of Nations was destroyed."
23,1968,HND,"I wish to make it very clear that it is not our intention to interfere in the domestic affairs of another State, since we are the first to defend the principle of non-intervention, but it is the very suppliers of foreign aid that have not had the moral integrity to prevent hunger from being used in that civil war as a means of combat as a fearful weapon for killing not only combatants but also women and children, in a drama of genocide that the United Nations cannot disregard."
23,1968,SDN,"The United States, which has spent billions of dollars on instruments of war and destruction, would do well to recall its forces and stop its intervention, and spare the lives of the Viet-Namese as well as of its own people."
23,1968,SDN,It ought to have been obvious that foreign intervention would only exacerbate the differences and disagreement between the two parts of the country and result in war and destruction.
23,1968,GIN,In those tragic situations there is also a humanitarian aspect that could fully justify intervention by the champions of the reasoning that we are denouncing.
23,1968,GIN,"In those cases, however, they have always taken refuge behind the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of States, which here as elsewhere should give way to the right of peoples to self-determination."
23,1968,GIN,In that resolution the African Heads of State made an appeal to all States to refrain from any intervention in Nigeria.
23,1968,ECU,The inevitable consequence of this is the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States and the right of peoples to adopt whatever political system they wish.
23,1968,ECU,"And he added: “Only a violent upsurge of the international conscience will one day achieve general disarmament, destroy the weapons of mass murder, and create an international force which will punish the aggressor and guarantee true self-determination for the peoples and non-intervention”."
23,1968,ECU,"Admittedly in central Europe we have seen armed intervention in the internal affairs of the Czechoslovak people, who were trying to concord their socialist socio-economic system with the individual freedoms by which the Charter guarantees the dignity of the human personality."
23,1968,ECU,"Therefore, in testifying to the trust which my Government and my people place in the Organization, I declare that my delegation will be ready to condemn any aggression and to help to define aggression better within the United Nations, to promote methods for the peaceful solution of international disputes, to condemn any intervention in the internal affairs of States and any violation of their right to adopt whatever form of government they desire, and to condemn all forms of discrimination based on race, sex or religion."
23,1968,URY,Uruguay once again reaffirms its belief in the principles of self-determination of peoples and non-intervention by States.
23,1968,URY,"In 1928 at Havana, Uruguay proposed that the principle of non-intervention, based on the indispensable legal equality of all States without which this Assembly cannot even exist, should be made an institution."
23,1968,URY,"We reject intervention of any kind, not only flagrant military intervention but also other more subtle and cunning forms."
23,1968,URY,"In financing this propaganda and these activities, other Governments commit actual unlawful and reprehensible intervention."
23,1968,URY,"I would point out that Latin America, as in its advocacy of non-intervention, has again taken the lead here with the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which in the words of the delegation of Uruguay “is an exemplary instrument by virtue of its juridical acumen, its technical precision, its feeling for reality, and the clear-cut differentiation it establishes between the atom for war and the atom for peace”’."
23,1968,MUS,It also means that we subscribe whole-heartedly to the principles of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States and respect for the territorial integrity of all sovereign States.
23,1968,GAB,"When a State is going through those upheavals, we can at most allow other States, in their rightful concern to respect the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States, to remain passive."
23,1968,GAB,"What States cannot undertake with regard to another State by virtue of the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of others can be undertaken by the United Nations, in line with its duty to see to the protection of human life."
23,1968,GAB,"It must begin by seeking information on the origin of the events in order to determine their hidden motives and then go on to intervene in order to stop the massacres, by rendering harmless those who take refuge in the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of States in order to proceed coolly, without qualms, about their sorry business of grave-diggers."
23,1968,TUR,It should also be noted that in 1965 the General Assembly adopted a declaration on the inadmissibility of intervention in the domestic affairs of States and the protection of their independence and sovereignty [resolution 2131(XX)].
23,1968,TUR,"However, the military intervention in Czechoslovakia seriously affected the trend towards détente."
23,1968,ETH,"While my Sovereign’s efforts and his personal intervention have already led to the first series of serious dialogue between the Federal Government of Nigeria and the secessionist authorities, as it is becoming increasingly obvious to all sides that no lasting solution can be found except on the basis of the will of the Nigerian people as a whole and of extending justice and security to all elements of the population, it is our fervent hope that the second round of dialogue will lead to a resolution of the strife."
23,1968,ETH,"If the Rhodesian economy has thus survived up to now, it certainly is not due to divine intervention or a miracle."
23,1968,DZA,"No parallel can be drawn between the responsibilities of a small State defending itself against foreign aggression and those of a great Power mounting a military intervention in a territory that does not belong to it, against a people who wish freely to decide their own destiny."
23,1968,DZA,"The main responsibility undoubtedly lies with the United Kingdom, and it was at the prompting of that country that the Security Council refused to consider armed intervention, and decided to apply only economic sanctions."
23,1968,DZA,Foreign intervention under the guise of humanitarian aid is intended only to aggravate the crisis and stir up trouble in the African continent.
23,1968,DZA,"We must be on our guard against such intervention, whose motives and aims we fully appreciate, and we condemn it most strongly."
23,1968,VEN,"We are especially concerned over violations of the principle of non-intervention, the formulation and defence of which may be counted among the most notable advances of our times."
23,1968,VEN,"Undoubtedly, they constitute a flagrant violation of the principles of non-aggression and of the self-determination of peoples, both of which are expressly set forth in the Charter of the United Nations, and of the principle of non-intervention formulated in resolution 2131(XX) and unanimously adopted by the General Assembly at its twentieth session on the initiative of the Soviet Union."
23,1968,VEN,"The Venezuelan Government, a firm champion of the principle of non-intervention, peaceful coexistence among nations and the right of self-determination, once again condemns that action."
23,1968,VEN,"Secondly, he has accused Venezuela of intervention in Guyana’s internal affairs and specifically accused our country of attempting to subvert the indigenous community of the disputed territory."
23,1968,NIC,"Consequently, armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements, are condemned”."
23,1968,GUY,"The Government of Venezuela, this Government which has stirred the Hemisphere with its protest at the interference of other Governments in its internal political life and which has invoked the great tradition of non-intervention which has been one of the outstanding contributions of Latin American jurisprudence to the international legal system, this Government has been and continues to be deeply involved in activities which constitute a gross interference in the political life of Guyana."
23,1968,GUY,Nor can we ignore that the principles of self-determination and non-intervention which have been breached in Czechoslovakia are no less threatened by the continuing tragedy of the conflict in Viet-Nam.
23,1968,CUB,"As we all know only too well, the discussion of this matter is a gross violation of the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States, as also of the United Nations Charter itself, Article 2 (7) of which expressly prohibits any interference in the sphere of jurisdiction of each State."
23,1968,CUB,"For three decades there raged throughout the island a cruel war of liberation, but one which led, not to independence, but to a new colonial yoke even more cruel and intolerable; this came about as a result of the military intervention of United States imperialism."
23,1968,YMD,I declare here my Government’s support for the heroic struggle of the Viet-Namese people against American colonialism and intervention.
23,1968,NLD,"The situation in that country once again focuses our attention on military intervention by the Soviet Union, assisted this time by four of its allies, in an Eastern European country."
23,1968,NLD,"The military invasion of Czechoslovakia, perpetrated in complete defiance of elementary rules of international law, makes a cruel irony of the Soviet initiative pressing for reaffirmation of the principles of sovereignty and non-intervention in a resolution which was finally unanimously adopted by the General Assembly."
23,1968,NLD,I do not wish to linger on the pretexts used by the Soviet invaders that the military intervention had been requested by the Czechoslovakia party and Government leaders.
23,1968,GRC,"Such a statute could in particular lay down the rules to be followed in the area of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of States  and in the matter of intergovernmental consultation whenever common interests might be involved, especial care being naturally taken not to impact upon commitments already entered into with respect to other countries."
23,1968,GRC,"At the same time the implementation of the principles of the settlement of disputes by peaceful means, of respect for sovereignty and independence, and of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States — principles that lie at the very basis of the resolution of 22 November 1967 — must be carried out not only in the Middle East, but everywhere in the world."
23,1968,GRC,The violation of the principles of non-intervention and free self-determination has been recognized as a direct threat by every country that regards respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter as the best assurance of and safeguard for its own sovereignty and independence.
23,1968,GRC,"We are no longer living in the distant past when Talleyrand could say: “Non-intervention is a metaphysical and political term that means more or less the same thing as intervention""."
23,1968,GRC,Thus the Assembly had very compelling reasons to condemn intervention — of any sort and under any circumstances - in the domestic affairs of any country in its resolution 2136(XX).
23,1968,MAR,We regard opposition to and defence against intervention and annexation as a natural and legitimate tight.
23,1968,MAR,"On this occasion, His Majesty’s Government wishes to restate its position of principle on this question and to repeat its disapproval of any armed intervention or any other kind of interference in the domestic or foreign affairs of States."
23,1968,BRB,"The flagrant intervention of the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countries in Czechoslovakia in August has shocked and horrified the people of Barbados, as it has the people of many small countries throughout the world."
23,1968,LKA,"For the great majority of Members of this Organization, devoid as they are of the means of protecting themselves from foreign intervention and from encroachments on their sovereignty and territorial integrity, assurances of security must come from the United Nations and its organs alone, thereby rendering obsolete the need for membership of military alliances which is itself, in a sense, a limitation on national sovereignty."
23,1968,LKA,"Our purpose in doing so was to refute the plea that foreign intervention in Viet-Nam, despite the Geneva Agreements of 1954, was designed to ensure for the people of Viet-Nam the right of self-determination."
23,1968,CHL,"So also, to give only two examples, are the principles of non-intervention and the right of asylum."
23,1968,CHL,"By a supreme paradox, in virtue of this very principle of non-intervention, this problem will not be debated here; but this situation cannot deprive us of the right to point out that a rule governing the matter is stated not only in the United Nations Charter."
23,1968,CHL,"armed intervention is synonymous with aggression and, as such, is contrary to the basic principles on which peaceful international co-operation between States should be built,”   that -  “The strict observance of these obligations is an essential condition to ensure that nations live together in peace with one another, since the practice of any form of intervention not only violates the spirit and letter of the Charter of the United Nations but also leads to the creation of situations which threaten international peace and security”;  and that -  “Every State has an inalienable right to choose its political, economic, social and cultural systems, without interference in any form by another State."
23,1968,ALB,"Our relations with States having different political systems are based on the principles of the sovereign equality of States both large and small, of non-intervention in their domestic affairs, of respect for their sovereignty and of mutually-advantageous co-operation."
23,1968,HTI,"Such international co-operation, based on the equality of States in law, reciprocal respect for their major interests, non-intervention by one State or group of States, on whatever pretext, in the affairs of another State in accordance with paragraph 7 of Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, together with the need for all forms of assistance to developing countries — that is the condition sine qua non for economic and social progress, for peace, and for the maintenance of cordial and friendly relations among peoples."
23,1968,HTI,"I believe that the same holds true for the very future of the United Nations, for the hopes for peace and for the economic and social advancement of the peoples of the world; since for several years the permanent members of the Security Council have themselves been the systematic violators of the fundamental principles of the San Francisco Charter—the legal equality of States, the self-determination of peoples, and non-intervention."
23,1968,HTI,"The present Secretary-General of the Organization of American States — whom the American nations remember for his forceful intervention when the United States Congress proposed making a heavy cut in the amount of aid to be allocated to the under-developed countries — replied:  “It is a striking coincidence that at the present time a technical assistance mission of the Organization of American States is being set up for Haiti, some of whose members are already at Port-au-Prince."
23,1968,BEL,"That is why the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States, of non-interference, of unwarranted intervention, must in face of the facts be respected with special strictness by those who have asked the rest of the world to sanction their power and to repose special confidence in them."
23,1968,BEL,armed intervention is synonymous with aggression.
23,1968,BEL,"In short, we considered that that resolution as a whole adequately defined what was, in the unanimous opinion of the community of nations, the duty of non-intervention."
23,1968,BEL,It is said that the Yalta agreements of 1945 authorize and legitimize intervention by the great Powers within their spheres of influence.
23,1968,BEL,"On the other side it has been contended — and I am thinking in particular of an article that appeared in Pravda on 26 September 1968 and whose philosophy seems to be echoed in the recent statement made by my colleague from the Soviet Union [1679th meeting] — that all the classical concepts of non-aggression, non-intervention, sovereignty and independence are valueless in relations among socialist countries because they are abstract and devoid of class content."
23,1968,BEL,I would recall that the statement on non-intervention which I mentioned earlier was adopted by our Assembly at the suggestion of the Soviet Union.
23,1968,BEL,"I would further recall that the initial draft submitted by the USSR to the first Committee contained an article inviting “all States to be guided in their international relations by the principles of mutual respect and of non-intervention in domestic affairs for any reason” — and the proposal was very clear: “whether economic, political or ideological""."
23,1968,BEL,"I should like to recall that at the twenty-first session, returning to this question of non-intervention, the USSR representative, Mr."
23,1968,BEL,"Kuznetzov, stated: ""We should recognize that every State has the inalienable right to settle for itself without any foreign intervention, questions concerning its future""."
23,1968,BEL,"Lastly, in another context, it has been maintained that Articles 53 and 107 of the Charter, together or separately, would allow a unilateral intervention in the domestic affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany."
23,1968,BEL,"What conclusions are we to draw from this survey? It is that the path of peace, in other words our own path, lies through scrupulous respect for the principle of non-intervention as set forth by our Assembly."
23,1968,BEL,"Debré called the prime safeguard of human rights [1683rd meeting], namely the principle of non-intervention; and positive contributions to the strengthening of our institutions, to economic development and to disarmament."
23,1968,MRT,"Further attacks on the freedom of nations, on their right to self-determination, on respect for territorial integrity and on non-intervention in the domestic affairs of States are being launched in various regions of our planet in defiance of the fundamental principles of the Charter."
23,1968,MRT,The Viet-Nam war is one of the most savage examples of violation of the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of States.
23,1968,MRT,"Faithful to the principle of non-alignment, and holding respect for the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of States to be essential, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania is bound to deplore the intervention and maintenance of foreign troops in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic."
23,1968,AUS,It was intervention by force against the wishes of the lawful Government of Czechoslovakia and without the invitation or even the acquiescence of the legislature of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of that country.
23,1968,ROU,"The relevance today of the precepts enshrined in the Charter is revealed both by the discussions at this session and by the work our Organization has undertaken for the codification of the principles that should govern relations among States, in particular the eschewing of the threat or use of force, the settlement of disputes by peaceful means, non-intervention in domestic affairs, equal rights and the duty to co-operate in accordance with the Charter, the right of peoples to self-determination and the carrying out in good faith of obligations assumed under the Charter."
23,1968,KHM,"if the principle of non-intervention in the free destiny of nations is not re-established, the future of international peace and security itself is indeed a very dark one” [A/7201/Add."
23,1968,KHM,"The Cambodian delegation shares that view and would like to point out that ten years ago, from this very platform [756th meeting], the Cambodian Head of State, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, drew the attention of the United Nations to the serious consequences of intervention by the great Powers in the affairs of other countries."
23,1968,KHM,"Alas, we are compelled to observe that intervention, not only political and economic but also military, has become so common that it provokes nothing more than purely formal protests, either in the United Nations or by international public opinion."
23,1968,KHM,"Faithful to its policy of peace and true independence, Cambodia has never ceased to condemn foreign intervention in the affairs of others."
23,1968,KHM,"This problem of non-intervention leads the Cambodian delegation to denounce once again the invasion of South Viet-Nam by United States armed forces and the war, unprecedented in history, that is being waged against the Viet-Namese people."
23,1968,KHM,It must be remembered that the origin of the Viet-Nam war was the legitimate revolt of the South Viet-Namese people against the dictatorship of Ngo Dinh Diem and the illegal intervention by the American armed forces in that domestic dispute.
23,1968,KHM,"It is for the Viet-Namese, and the Viet-Namese only, to settle their domestic affairs as they choose, and any foreign intervention in those affairs is and must be condemned."
23,1968,ZMB,The President of the Republic of Zambia roundly condemned Russian military intervention in Czechoslovakia.
23,1968,ZMB,"In our approach to the problem of intervention in the domestic affairs of States and the protection of their independence and sovereignty, we shall always continue to be guided by resolution 2131(XX) of 21 December 1965, in paragraph 1 of which the General Assembly solemnly declares:  “No State has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State."
23,1968,ZMB,"Consequently, armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements are condemned."
23,1968,CYP,"But we thought that, in so far as war and peace were concerned, and in so far as the universality of the principles of non-intervention and sovereign equality were concerned, there was only one family; and that was the United Nations."
23,1968,CYP,When the item on non-intervention was discussed and the relevant resolution [2131(XX)] adopted by the General Assembly three years ago it was stressed that all Members of the United Nations were equal and that any intervention or interference for whatever reason in the internal affairs of any State was absolutely prohibited.
23,1968,ARG,"Another principle equal in importance and dear to the hearts of Latin-Americans, provides it natural complement, is the principle of non-intervention."
23,1968,ARG,"I must, however, underline once again the need to give lasting effect to the principles of non-intervention, independence and national sovereignty."
23,1968,ARG,"The military intervention in Czechoslovakia, the long conflict in Viet-Nam, the situation in the Middle East, the attempts to maintain colonial situations despite the will of the international community, the lack of real progress on the problem of disarmament and the precarious strategic situation in Central Europe, are negative factors whose importance and consequences we must underline if we wish to advance along the road to peace and security for all."
23,1968,TZA,"None the less, it is our conviction that there is no legitimate basis for the intervention by any foreign nation in this conflict."
23,1968,TZA,"What peace, what security exists in Viet-Nam as a result of the intervention of these Powers? Is it not clear that because of this intervention there is more suffering and more insecurity? The United Republic of Tanzania believes that the people of Viet-Nam themselves hold the key to a peaceful settlement of the conflict there."
23,1968,BEN,"Under cover of alleged “higher interests"", the principle of the sovereign equality of States and that of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of States, have been flouted with impunity."
23,1968,BEN,"True to its foreign policy which is based, among other principles, on resolute hostilities to all forms of subjection and domination of one people by another, Dahomey, on 22 August last, reaffirmed with respect to the events in Czechoslovakia its position on strict respect for the sovereignty and integrity of all States, non-intervention in their domestic affairs and their right to self-determination."
23,1968,LAO,"However justified the motives for the Soviet Union’s intervention in Czechoslovakia may be, we address to that great country, on behalf of all countries devoted to peace, justice and international understanding, a final appeal not to take any irreparable step so that the deeply disturbed universal conscience may be reassured, and that those small countries which for their own protection have put their hopes in respect for the principles of the Charter by all Members of the United Nations may not come to believe that our Organization is completely ineffective."
23,1968,LAO,"The construction of the Ho Chi Minh trail, several hundred kilometres long, most of it on Laotian territory, and the deployment of immense human resources for the protection of that crossing and entry route for North Viet-Namese soldiers on their way to South Viet-Nam, constitute in themselves the most insolent intervention."
23,1968,LAO,The Laotian Government has issued two white papers denouncing North Viet-Namese intervention.
23,1968,LAO,"It is distressing that, after twenty-three years existence, the United Nations should tolerate open attacks by sinister forces avid for hegemony and domination on the great principles of non-interference, non-intervention, self-determination, peaceful coexistence and respect for independence which constitute the very bases of the Charter."
23,1968,JPN,"This military intervention, though unaccompanied by large-scale bloodshed, was indisputably an act incompatible with the spirit and the letter of the United Nations Charter."
23,1968,JPN,"The major premise for peace is that each and every country should endeavour td live in coexistence with its neighbours on the basis of the principle of non-intervention, transcending differences in social systems and respecting each other’s sovereignty and independence."
23,1968,JPN,"Once peace is realized, then all the people of Viet-Nam should determine their future themselves without any foreign influence or intervention."
23,1968,BLR,"The Byelorussian Soviet Republic was founded on 1 January 1919, as a result of the Great October Socialist Revolution, in the difficult years of foreign intervention and civil war."
23,1968,IDN,"It is the inalienable right of the people of that country, as of any independent country, to determine its own future free from foreign intervention or pressure."
68,2013,BOL,"Nevertheless, a handful of Powers promote  wars, armed conflict and military intervention without  respecting even international organizations."
68,2013,BOL,The security of the empire and the fight against  terrorism have become the biggest excuse and tool  for unilateral military intervention.
68,2013,BOL,Capitalism wants to emerge from its  crisis through war and armed intervention.
68,2013,BOL,"Who distributes  the natural resources after an intervention? Whose  hands do they end up in, once countries are bombed?  Who is really governing in the United States, I wonder?  Is it its citizens, or the companies that promote wars?  From outside, at least — I am not an ambassador living  in the United States — what we see is that those who  finance political and election campaigns are bankers  and big businessmen, and they are the ones setting  policy."
68,2013,BOL,"We are facing a new moment in the imperial  geopolitical disposition — and I do not wish to revisit  how Latin America and the Caribbean, like Africa and  the Middle East, were at one time carved up by various  imperial Powers, who were interested not in resolving  issues of poverty, democracy and equality but rather  in those countries’ natural resources — and now, once  again, those Powers wish to divide it all up through  military intervention and with military bases."
68,2013,BOL,"I would like to know who owned the oil in Libya  beforehand? Who owns it now? Previously, at the least,  the people of Libya benefited from that oil, but how is it  being managed and used now? What happened in Iraq?  I am convinced that behind any war or intervention,  a plan is being devised on how to later seize the  natural resources."
68,2013,MLI,"Had  it not been for that intervention, I would not be standing  here before the Assembly today."
68,2013,SMR,"Our thanks go to the Secretary-General, the Office  for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the  Central Emergency Response Fund for their prompt and  crucial intervention in favour of populations affected  by natural disasters."
68,2013,GUY,It is an  illusion to believe that military intervention will bring  peace to that country.
68,2013,DMA,We must be forever mindful that those who are  condemned to poverty still await our intervention.
68,2013,NER,"We must recognize  also that, while ECOWAS rightly and promptly opted  for a military intervention, most of the States that were  supposed to mobilize troop contingents were slow  to make them available and operational."
68,2013,NER,"The Niger calls for an international  intervention, as in Mali in January 2013, to put an end  to the martyrdom of the people of the Central African  Republic."
68,2013,NLD,The Netherlands supports the proposal that permanent  Security Council members should henceforth refrain  from using their veto power in votes on intervention  to stop the mass atrocity crimes identified by the  2005 World Summit.
68,2013,PRK,"The unjust intervention,  pressure and use of force that is unfolding in Syria by  way of infringements on its sovereignty and territorial  integrity, which further breach peace and stability,  should not be allowed under any circumstances, and the  United States blockade against Cuba should be brought  to an end at the earliest possible date."
68,2013,VAT,"However, history has also shown that, when  the necessary means are insufficient or the prevailing  national and international interests weigh too heavily,  United Nations intervention cannot be realized or, if it  is undertaken, has only limited success."
68,2013,SVK,"Thoughtful  reflection on all the possible consequences of a military  intervention in Syria makes it clear that there is only  one good solution to this conflict, the diplomatic one."
68,2013,SVK,The analysis of the  consequences of such action must be at least as detailed  and elaborate as that of how to conduct a potential  intervention.
68,2013,STP,"Therefore, the Democratic Republic of  Sao Tome and Principe, out of concern for the suffering  of the tormented people of our sister nation, appeals to  the entire international community for a more vigorous  intervention to mitigate their suffering, preserve  national sovereignty and help national political actors  to promote national unity and political stability."
68,2013,ARG,My country  opposed direct intervention — bombing.
68,2013,TGO,"Here I would like to touch on the case of Mali, where  the danger represented by terrorist groups and extremist  jihadists, coupled with a serious humanitarian crisis,  prompted the United Nations to action with a speedy  military intervention and peacekeeping operation."
68,2013,SUR,Their willingness and capacity for further dialogue and  persuasion is a better way to achieve and maintain peace  than the use of violence and military intervention.
68,2013,BHR,"The second of our three strategic pillars encompasses  support for the principles of good-neighbourliness,  non-intervention in the internal affairs of others,  abiding by the provisions of international law and its  instruments and peaceful coexistence."
68,2013,BHR,"The first of those challenges is the important task  of putting an end to Iranian intervention in the internal  affairs of the countries of the region and to its occupation  of the three Emirates islands of Greater Tunb, Lesser  Tunb and Abu Musa."
68,2013,BRA,Unilateral intervention would  only further worsen the lack of political stability in the  region and would increase human suffering.
68,2013,PRY,"Paraguay’s contribution is essential in today’s  integrated reality and is indissolublely linked to our  dignity as a free nation, sovereign and independent,  under the premise of the right to the self-determination  of peoples and the principles of non-intervention and  the legal equality of States."
68,2013,GMB,"The embargo  against Cuba contravenes the fundamental principles  of international law, international humanitarian law,  the Charter of the United Nations and the norms and  principles governing peaceful relations among States,  violating the sovereign equality of States and the  principles of non-intervention and non-interference  in the domestic affairs of other Member States."
68,2013,AGO,"This session of the General Assembly is taking  place in a complex international climate, one where the  intervention of the international community is needed  to provide lasting solutions to conflicts that constitute  serious threats to international peace and security."
68,2013,TUN,"We have been warning for a long time now  about the problems of the militarization of the events,  of factionalism, sectarianism and outside intervention,  whether by States or so-called jihadi groups, including  some from Tunisia, which we know will be a danger to  us when they return from that suffering country."
68,2013,KNA,"Violence against women and children must  be seen not as a personal or family matter, but instead  as a socially destructive behaviour demanding judicial  intervention."
68,2013,TCD,"In spite of all those efforts, we must  recognize that the needs on the ground clearly highlight  the need for swift intervention, admittedly in the spirit  of regional solidarity but also with the vital support of  the international community."
68,2013,USA,"In Mali, we supported both the French  intervention that successfully pushed back Al-Qaida  and the African forces who are keeping the peace."
68,2013,USA,"They point to the problems  that the country now confronts — a democratically  elected Government struggling to provide security;  armed groups, in some places extremists, ruling parts  of a fractured land — and these critics argue that any  intervention to protect civilians is doomed to fail."
68,2013,VCT,"At the same time, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  is very impressed by the efforts of the President of  the United States to embrace diplomacy rather than  military intervention in pursuit of a political settlement  in Syria."
68,2013,VEN,"We  have demonstrated that without military intervention,  drones or economic blockades, we can build and  preserve genuine democracy and move forward in  combating hunger, poverty and inequality."
68,2013,IRN,"Military intervention in Afghanistan, Saddam  Hussein’s imposed war against Iran, the occupation  of Kuwait, military interventions against Iraq, the  brutal repression of the Palestinian people, the  assassination of ordinary people and political figures  in Iran and terrorist bombings in countries such as Iraq,  Afghanistan and Lebanon are examples of the acts of  violence committed in that region in the past three  decades."
68,2013,SYR,Political  hypocrisy allows them to intervene in the domestic  affairs of States under the pretext of humanitarian  intervention or the responsibility to protect.
35,1980,DZA,"This redeployment of the forces of imperialism by a feverish quest for new bases, in particular in the Middle East, in Africa and in the Indian Ocean and by the establishment and consolidation of rapid means of intervention, as well as the right that those forces disdainfully arrogate to themselves here and there to protect the maritime routes and supply sources of raw materials and energy, disregarding the sovereignty of States, are harbingers of new attacks upon the security of our countries."
35,1980,IRL,"The United Nations as we inherit it is an Organization which comprises States and groups of States which differ greatly in outlook, culture, ideology and political orientation; and fundamental to its structure are the principles of national sovereignty and respect for non-intervention."
35,1980,IRL,A major crisis has erupted in the region of southern Asia as a result of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
35,1980,IRL,"We know, too, that the African States oppose intervention by outside Powers in their affairs."
35,1980,IRL,Such intervention can only compound the conflicts that exist.
35,1980,IRL,"Afghanistan must be enabled to resume its traditional neutrality and non- alignment, to remain outside competition between the Powers and to maintain friendly relations with its neighbours, Conditions must be created in which the people of Afghanistan can determine their own form of government and decide their destiny free from outside intervention, in accordance with General Assembly resolution ES-6/2 adopted on 14 January 1980."
35,1980,COG,"Indeed, the General Assembly's right to discuss questions falling within the purview of international relations should not include any intervention in a field which falls essentially within national competence."
35,1980,COG,"This is even more disquieting, given the outbreak of new and serious scattered conflicts, with the constant threat of fearsome foreign intervention."
35,1980,BTN,"We firmly believe that, as is stated in the Declaration of the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Nonaligned Countries, the quintessence of the policy of nonalignment is the rejection of all forms of subjugation, interference or intervention, direct or indirect, and of all pressures, whether political, economic, military or cultural, in international relations."
35,1980,CMR,It seems to us to be indispensable to reverse the present trend towards excessive militarization of that region and to promote there a new climate of detente and co-operation free from any outside intervention and hegemonistic rivalries.
35,1980,PER,"Full observance of the principle of non-intervention, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, self-determination and compliance with international treaties are the bases of all international legal order, to which Peru adheres."
35,1980,PER,"At the recent meeting of the Heads of State of the Andean countries at Riobamba, Ecuador, it was possible to reaffirm the democratic will of the members of the Group and their firm intention to observe human rights, it being assumed that the principle of non-intervention cannot be separated from that of the self-determination of peoples."
35,1980,LAO,"We fully support the tenacious struggle of the peoples and Governments of Grenada, Jamaica and other countries of the region against the manoeuvres of intervention and subversion of the imperialists and their lackeys and in defence of their independence and sovereignty."
35,1980,PHL,Both arise from the same root cause: they constitute open and flagrant violations of the principle of non-interference and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other countries.
35,1980,CIV,"Only neutrality of that kind can protect them from subversion, interference and foreign intervention."
35,1980,CIV,lt leads to the death of freedom and encourages subversion and foreign interference and intervention in those countries.
35,1980,ARG,"At the same time, it is essential that all nations, especially the two great Powers, refrain from infringing the principles of non-interference and non-intervention in the internal affairs of States."
35,1980,ARG,"Only thus will the movement of nonaligned countries be a reflection of the feeling of international responsibility of a significant number of States, which, over and above their political, economic and social differences, attempt to direct international relations towards full respect for non-intervention through solidarity and cooperation among peoples."
35,1980,MLI,"It is also the lack of respect for the principles of the Charter—the principles of non-recourse to force, avoidance of foreign military intervention, non-interference in the internal affairs of States and the peaceful settlement of disputes—which has given to the crises in Afghanistan and Kampuchea dimensions which go beyond the national borders of those countries."
35,1980,BFA,"With regard to Afghanistan, notwithstanding the unequivocal condemnation by the international community of the Soviet intervention, that nonaligned Moslem State remains the theatre of bloody operations aimed at breaking any national resistance."
35,1980,ITA,"Here I should like, first of all, to refer to the crisis that began nine months ago with the intervention of Soviet military forces in Afghanistan, and in this regard I should like to recall the pertinent and timely resolution adopted by this Assembly last January at the end of its sixth emergency special session."
35,1980,ITA,"The work done this year at Geneva by the Committee on Disarmament, even in the international climate prevailing in the wake of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, has shown that the possibility and the will to continue disarmament negotiations exist."
35,1980,AGO,"Many threats of aggression, of military intervention, of economic sanctions were then forthcoming from the imperialist Powers."
35,1980,AGO,"We should not like to leave the African continent without referring, however briefly, to the tragedy which has afflicted the people of Chad as a consequence of numerous instances of foreign intervention."
35,1980,DEU,Hegemonic policies and resultant military intervention destroy the right of nations to self-determination.
35,1980,DEU,"Accordingly, the Federal Republic of Germany and France, in their joint declaration of 5 February 1980, described as unacceptable the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan and stated clearly that detente would not be able to withstand another blow of that kind."
35,1980,DEU,"At the sixth emergency special session of the General Assembly, held from 10 to 14 January this year, the international community condemned by an overwhelming majority the armed intervention in Afghanistan and called for the immediate, unconditional and total withdrawal of the foreign troops."
35,1980,DEU,"It urged that the people of Afghanistan be enabled to determine their own form of government and choose their economic, political and social systems free from outside intervention, subversion, coercion or constraint of any kind whatsoever."
35,1980,DEU,"Here, too, it has demanded that the people of Cambodia be enabled to choose their own government by the democratic process—without outside intervention, subversion or coercion."
35,1980,MOZ,"On behalf of the people and the Government of the People's Republic of Mozambique, I affirm our militant solidarity with the Revolutionary Democratic Front of El Salvador which, despite the threat of direct American intervention, is triumphantly guiding the people of El Salvador to victory."
35,1980,MOZ,Indonesia's military intervention in East Timor is a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of the most elementary standards of international relations.
35,1980,USA,"We must support the principles of non-intervention, self-determination and non-alignment for Afghanistan."
35,1980,USA,"As a new chapter opens, we emphasize that we recognize the reality of the Iranian revolution, and we respect the right of the Iranian people to choose their own form of government without intervention of any kind."
35,1980,ECU,"Ecuador repeats that its international policy is guided by the scrupulous observance of permanent principles that are the basis of international law and of the United Nations system, such as those of non-intervention, self-determination of peoples, the legal equality of States, absolute respect for human rights, ideological pluralism, opposition to all forms of racial discrimination, colonialism and neo-colonialism, rejection of all aggression, non-validity of territorial conquest achieved through the threat or use of force, and the defence and strengthening of the system of peaceful settlement of disputes."
35,1980,ECU,"I have the honour to announce that, in our Andean sub region, the heads of State of Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador and the Vice-President of Peru, representing that country's President, meeting this month in the city of Riobamba to commemorate the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the first Constitution of Ecuador, approved the Charter of Conduct that was proposed by President Rold6s and which, on this very subject, reads as follows: "" [It] reiterates the solemn commitment that respect for human, political, economic and social rights constitutes a fundamental rule of internal conduct for the States of the Andean Group, that the defence of those rights is an international obligation which is binding on States and that, therefore, joint action undertaken to protect such rights does not violate the principle of non-intervention""."
35,1980,HUN,"To that end they increased the military expenditures of the NATO countries, the long-term programmes for building up arms, the deployment in Western Europe of new American nuclear missiles of medium range but strategic in nature, the postponement of the ratification by the American Senate of the SALT II agreement and the creation of rapid deployment forces for purposes of intervention—to mention only the most striking instances of that effort."
35,1980,HUN,"The extremist circles of imperialism will stop at nothing to regain their lost positions, resorting to means ranging from overt intervention in the domestic affairs of other countries, through economic boycotts and sanctions, to the supply of arms to counterrevolutionaries scheming abroad against the legitimate Government."
35,1980,HUN,The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic is of the view that the key to the solution of the situation in that country is the halting of intervention by outside reactionary forces.
35,1980,HUN,"China's aggression against Viet Nam and its threats to ""teach it another lesson"", as well as its subversive acts against the neighbouring progressive regimes and its open intervention have given rise to tension in that region."
35,1980,GTM,"The foreign policy of Guatemala is based on principles enshrined in international law, such as non-intervention in the internal or external affairs of other States, the territorial integrity of nations, ideological pluralism, the sovereignty of countries, the peaceful settlement of disputes between States, good faith in the fulfilment of international undertakings and the development of international cooperation and solidarity."
35,1980,GTM,"If it does so, instead of helping to solve the problem, its intervention will constitute interference in bilateral negotiations."
35,1980,GTM,Guatemala rejects in this case the intervention of the United Nations and restates its position that it will not consider itself bound by the resolutions which have been adopted or which may be adopted on this question.
35,1980,MDG,"In some specific cases, this latter attitude has deteriorated into one of promoting imperialist power policies and has led certain countries to designate unilaterally so-called areas of vital interest, which are subject to the threat of intervention by forces that are specially trained and equipped for the purpose."
35,1980,MDG,"This year again, they are considering a draft declaration on the principle of non-intervention and non-interference in international relations."
35,1980,MDG,"The latent or open crises affecting the sub region of the Indian Ocean are potentially explosive and they imply, to varying degrees and according to each case, the transgression of principles which are dear to us, such as respect for the rights of peoples, the prohibition of racial discrimination, respect for the sovereignty of States and their territorial integrity, the peaceful settlement of disputes, non-interference and non-intervention, and the duty of cooperation among States."
35,1980,MDG,"But then why do they not include in that solution the rights of a revolutionary people, the validity of treaties of alliance, the proposals made by the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan in its declaration of 15 May 1980, the seventh clause of which quite rightly deals with the military and political activities carried out in the region of the Indian Ocean and the Gulf by States that come from outside the area? Truth cannot be one-sided and we would do better to submit the programme for a political settlement submitted by the Afghan Government to an objective examination rather than to engage in a debate based on unsound premises, which in itself amounts to interference in the internal affairs of a Member State and exposes the Organization to criticism which it cannot easily refute in view of its past silence in other cases of flagrant intervention in other continents."
35,1980,MDG,"And it is partly thinking about what could happen to our countries in case of a confrontation of this kind that we call for fulfilment of the conditions for a lasting peace in Korea and, therefore, in Asia, by promoting that country's independent reunification, putting an end to the interference and intervention by an external Power, eliminating foreign military bases and withdrawing foreign troops."
35,1980,FRA,The critical situation has taken on a very special significance since the intervention of the Soviet army in Afghanistan.
35,1980,FRA,What are the obstacles? The first is the intervention of a foreign army; the second is the temptation to turn that country into a stake or a threat.
35,1980,FRA,"Today it is compelled to say that the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan is unacceptable; that no security considerations can justify such action and that it is essential, in the interests of everyone—and that includes the Soviet Union itself—to find a political solution to the crisis that is consistent with the legitimate aspirations of the Afghan people and the requirements of international peace."
35,1980,SDN,"Therefore we condemn and denounce any foreign intervention or interference, from whatever source, in the domestic affairs of any country."
35,1980,SDN,"Foreign intervention, in whatever form, is irreconcilable with the duties and obligations of the States Members of the United Nations."
35,1980,SDN,"The Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, to take a recent example, is still a source of concern to the international community because of its serious repercussions and implications in the region and the world at large."
35,1980,SDN,"It is gratifying, however, to note that the Korean people in the North and the South are exerting serious efforts to reunify the peninsula peacefully and without foreign intervention."
35,1980,ZMB,"In that regard, it is imperative that all foreign troops be withdrawn and that the principles of non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of States be scrupulously respected by all foreign Powers."
35,1980,BEN,"For the flames of war between Iraq and Iran, the deaths and the immense sacrifices imposed upon those two fraternal peoples will in no way benefit the struggle of the Palestinian people or that of other peoples of the world against imperialist domination and intervention."
35,1980,BEN,"For this suffice it to observe the cynicism of certain plans for intervention or suspect offers of mediation, whose sole goal and motivation is the logic of the stock market and the statistics of the energy needs of the West."
35,1980,EGY,"Regardless of the excesses attributed to one regime or another in that country, no justification of military intervention and external interference to impose a certain regime on a people is acceptable."
35,1980,EGY,"In various parts of Africa we see attempts at foreign intervention, which we deplore regardless of its origin."
35,1980,JPN,"Just as the decade of the 1980s was dawning, the Soviet Union launched a military intervention in Afghanistan."
35,1980,JPN,"The military intervention in Afghanistan by the Soviet Union at the end of last year not only violates the main principles of non-intervention and non-use of force as contained in the United Nations Charter, it also seriously jeopardizes international peace and security."
35,1980,JPN,"The problem of the Afghan refugees, which has been exacerbated by the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan, is no less painful to me than the IndoChinese refugee problem."
35,1980,NGA,"During that period some of them have fought civil wars not out of irreconcilable differences of ideology or ethnicity; they have fought in order to defend the gains of their independence, to frustrate foreign intervention in their affairs and to maximize their sovereign attributes."
35,1980,GAB,"A year ago, from this very rostrum, I deliberately made hope the watchword of my intervention, and I am pleased to point out that that hope was not altogether unwarranted, since today we rejoice at the admission of two new Member States to our Organization: Zimbabwe, which joined the international community during the eleventh special session, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, which we welcomed just a few days ago."
35,1980,MYS,Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan resulted in the United States withholding ratification of the SALT II agreement and increased military activity in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf area.
35,1980,MYS,Vietnamese intervention in Kampuchea resulted in Chinese troops moving across the Vietnamese border.
35,1980,MYS,There is no credible rationale that any country can provide for direct or indirect military intervention in the affairs of independent and sovereign nations.
35,1980,MYS,"It is only on this basis that the seeds of future intervention and interference in the internal affairs of that country, either by regional or extra-regional Powers, will be removed and that South-East Asian countries can together determine factors of peace and security as envisaged in the concept of that region as a zone of peace, advocated by the ASEAN countries."
35,1980,MYS,"The common denominator of military intervention threatens to embroil both regions of Asia, affecting stability and order."
35,1980,MYS,Such measures must leave no room for doubt as to what constitutes intervention and what constitutes co-operation.
35,1980,MYS,They must not allow countries to twist aggression into co-operation or intervention into assistance.
35,1980,COL,"Guaranteeing the fundamental rights of all the countries in the Middle East requires a search for an appropriate solution to the serious crisis in Lebanon, a nation that has been suffering from very tragic circumstances and whose plight the United Nations cannot ignore if it is to retain its territorial integrity without outside intervention."
35,1980,ISL,A vast majority of the nations represented in this distinguished body strongly deplored the armed intervention in Afghanistan in a resolution adopted in January of this year by the sixth emergency special session.
35,1980,IND,We have consistently emphasized the inadmissibility of the use of force in international relations or intervention or interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States.
35,1980,IND,"But if we desire to move towards finding a positive solution, what is required is an assiduous and continued effort to devise suitable package solutions which take care of the concerns of all and succeed in eliminating outside intervention and interference."
35,1980,MLT,"Adventurism, interference, and even intervention arrogantly stride the world stage."
35,1980,SWE,"Viet Nam, once the symbol of the people’s fight for independence, has now itself embarked on the road of armed intervention."
35,1980,SWE,Today it is more important than ever to remind the superpowers of their duty to adhere to the United Nations principles on non-intervention and the right to self-determination.
35,1980,DOM,"From the earliest days of its independence, the Dominican Republic has on numerous occasions demonstrated heroism, courage and devotion to the rule of freedom despite the trials and tribulations to which we have been subjected throughout our history by the vicissitudes of international politics, from which we have been able to emerge with strengthened independence to the extent that it can be said that we are today perhaps one of the few countries in the world that has recovered, without foreign assistance, its status as a sovereign and independent nation, a status that was lost as a result of armed intervention which undermined its republican institutions, but, despite its duration, did not succeed in extinguishing our national spirit."
35,1980,DOM,maintain an unswerving policy of neutrality and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States as the mainstay of our international relations.

35,1980,BLR,"I should like in particular to stress that no attempts— whether at this session of the General Assembly or elsewhere—to resolve the problems of the Afghan people in defiance of its will, no plans affecting the sovereignty of the Afghan State or disregarding its lawful Government and which fail to guarantee the security of Afghanistan against the intervention of bandits from outside in its internal affairs can possibly be successful."
35,1980,IRN,"The United States has attempted to secure military bases in the region and to establish rapid deployment forces for direct American intervention in the region, 317."
35,1980,SOM,"Unable to suppress the intensifying liberation struggles, they have in desperation facilitated direct military intervention by the Soviet Union, a Power which has particularly recently, achieved notoriety for its exploitation of such situations."
35,1980,SOM,That unwarranted intervention has been at the expense of those still struggling to assert their rights to self-determination and independence: it has encouraged intransigence and persistent colonialism on the part of the cruel regime in Addis Ababa and has totally frustrated every avenue which might otherwise have led to a just resolution of the problems of the Horn of Africa through negotiation.
35,1980,SOM,"Soviet-led intervention apart, I must re-emphasize that the problems of the Horn of Africa have one root cause and one alone; I refer of course to persistent colonialism on the part of Abyssinia."
35,1980,SOM,"The dangerous combination of militarism, foreign intervention, confrontation and instability is but a consequence of the forcible denial of the inalienable rights of these peoples to self-determination and to shape their own destiny."
35,1980,SOM,"Surprisingly, they also failed to reiterate the well-known OAU position that foreign Ibices should refrain from intervention in Africa's internal problems."

35,1980,TCD,"With that in view, we urge countries supporting the armed rebellion against the Provisional Government of National Union to put an end to their intervention in Chad's internal affairs."
35,1980,SLV,We must reiterate that relations among sovereign States must be based on mutual respect for the principle of non-intervention.

35,1980,YUG,"Bearing in mind the dangers arising from a continuous multiplication of global crises, we attach particular attention to the initiative of the nonaligned countries in elaborating a declaration on the inadmissibility of intervention and interference in the internal affairs of States."

35,1980,CAF,"Faced with that situation, my delegation can only deplore the foreign and African intervention carried out in an attempt to divide the country, and we condemn all exploitation of that crisis as well as all attempts at selfish domination, to the detriment of the interests of the people of Chad."
35,1980,DNK,The armed Vietnamese intervention in Kampuchea nearly two years ago and its implications for the neighbouring States remain a matter of serious concern to the world at large.
35,1980,DNK,"At its sixth emergency session, held from 10 to 14 January this year, the General Assembly adopted by an overwhelming majority a resolution urging the Soviet Union to abide by the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and promptly put an end to its military intervention in Afghanistan."
35,1980,LCA,"For example, the ease with which States set up human rights standards only to compromise them on the alter of national and political interest; the reasons presented in convenient and different formats to justify intervention, which cannot be defended by logical, significant and acceptable argument; the use and misuse of the movement of persons to satisfy political interests, with little regard to the real issue in humanitarian and refugee terms; the problems that are created because the political interest negates the possibility of working out reasonable, logical and objective rules of procedure that will govern and reflect the existence of expanding interest groups within the Committees, the regional groups and the major organs of this Organization."
35,1980,GMB,"It is my duty, therefore, to remind the international community that despite national efforts and international intervention, the situation in the Sahel has not improved significantly."
35,1980,PAK,"This small, independent, nonaligned Muslim country has been subjected to military intervention on a massive scale, in violation of the national rights of the Afghan people and the sacrosanct principle of nonalignment and of the Charter of the United Nations."
35,1980,PAK,"The deeply felt resentment of the international community and of the Muslim world in particular against this act of armed intervention has been clearly expressed in the demand for the immediate, unconditional and total withdrawal of Soviet military forces from Afghanistan."
35,1980,IDN,"We note with deep concern that open armed intervention and interference in the internal affairs of small States by more powerful countries has been introduced as a new, disturbing phenomenon in the relations between States."
35,1980,IDN,My delegation notes with deep concern the continuing conflict in Kampuchea resulting from the armed intervention by Viet Nam in violation of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
35,1980,IDN,At the thirty-fourth session the General Assembly focused attention on this military intervention and its attendant threat to international peace and adopted resolution 34/22 by an overwhelming majority calling for the prompt withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea.
35,1980,IDN,"With regard to the situation in Afghanistan, we are concerned about the continuing intervention in the internal affairs of a Member State belonging to the nonaligned movement."
35,1980,CAN,"And just as we must accept change in our economic relationships and reject intervention and the economic subordination of one country by another, so we must reject the political and military equivalents."
35,1980,ETH,"Consequently, extensive military preparations are under way, including the formation of a quick intervention force."
35,1980,ETH,"Having as its main target the States of the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean region, the quick intervention force poses a grave threat to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of those States and to their right freely to engage in international economic activities."
35,1980,ETH,"With contingents of its quick intervention forces concentrated at Berbera, Kismayu and Mogadishu, the United States has in effect taken a direct-assault position against Ethiopia and all those countries in the region which refuse to submit to imperialist domination and pursue an independent path of social and economic development."

35,1980,BGD,"Bangladesh, therefore, is firmly of the view that the solution of these problems lies in the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops and in the creation of conditions to enable the people of these countries to have a Government of their own choice without any external intervention, military or otherwise."
35,1980,SAU,"Also, we are suspicious of and question the conduct of the super-Powers that proclaim themselves the protectors of world peace and security, while at the same time they do not hesitate to use sheer force, domination and military intervention to impose their will and achieve their greedy aims."
35,1980,SAU,"However, what is important is to see the good offices continued in order to put an end to the conflict without any foreign intervention, whether from the super-Powers or any other quarter."
35,1980,SAU,"It is an aggression and an intervention committed by a super-Power that constantly claimed to be pursuing a policy of international peace and friendship and proclaimed itself the protector of world peace against an independent and sovereign State, a full- fledged Member State of the United Nations, and a member of the Islamic Conference and the non-aligned movement."
35,1980,SAU,All attempts by the Soviet Union and the regime it imposed by force and coercion on the people of Afghanistan to find justification and fabricate pretexts for and allegations to cover and defend that intervention and aggression have failed.
35,1980,SAU,"That is because intervention in the internal affairs of other States is totally rejected, since it is incompatible with the right of peoples to self-determination and deprives those peoples of the freedom to choose their own system of Government."
35,1980,SAU,"What renders that intervention more objectionable and reprehensible is the fact that it came from a super-Power' in such magnitude and violence as to attain the dimensions of an attempt physically to obliterate the people of Afghanistan, with acts of aggression committed against the sanctity of mosques and peaceful villages, and their strafing with napalm bombs."
35,1980,SAU,"However, the States members of the Islamic Conference, with one voice, have shown the world the serious dimensions of that intervention, condemned the Soviet Union and stressed their demand for an unconditional and complete withdrawal of the Soviet military presence from Afghanistan and non-recognition of and non-co-operation with the regime established there."
35,1980,MNG,The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic favours an immediate political settlement of the situation concerning Afghanistan which emerged as a result of intervention against that sovereign State organized by Washington and Beijing through their accomplices.
35,1980,MNG,"The basis for such a settlement is contained in the proposals put forward by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan on 14 May of this year, Cessation of the counterrevolutionary intervention is the basic prerequisite for achieving that goal."
35,1980,CHL,"The urgent meetings of the Security Council and the emergency special session of the General Assembly, which condemned that intervention, have proved to be futile in resolving that situation."
35,1980,CHL,"We have witnessed with amazement the intervention in that small country of one of the super-Powers which, because of its military might appears to feel itself invulnerable in the face of the outcry of the international community."
35,1980,CHL,"Our firm support for decolonization and the self- determination of peoples is accompanied by our forceful condemnation of all types of racial discrimination, including apartheid, and of all foreign intervention in the solution of Africa's problems."
35,1980,CHL,"However, we cannot conceal our concern over the foreign intervention and the escalation of terrorism in some regions of America."
35,1980,CHL,"Among other principles, we place emphasis on equal rights, the sovereign equality of States, the fulfilment in good faith of obligations undertaken, the peaceful settlement of disputes, the refraining from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States, the self-determination of peoples and international co-operation."

35,1980,BHS,"The Government of the Bahamas strongly condemns armed intervention against those two countries by foreign Powers, in violation of principles enshrined in the Charter."
35,1980,GRD,And all of us must be prepared to assist in defending that right and to struggle against any attempts at destabilization and intervention.
35,1980,GRD,From the very beginning we have faced the threat of military intervention from mercenaries who serve the cause of imperialism.
35,1980,GRD,"Very early in our revolution we faced what might be called a diplomatic-economic intervention, when imperialist interests again threatened to ruin our tourist industry unless we abided by their dictates."
35,1980,GRD,"Soon after, we had the experience of violent intervention, when local counter-revolutionary elements in alliance with Mafia and imperialist agents vainly sought to turn back our revolution by overt and covert intervention."
35,1980,GRD,"We call for the support of the United Nations in our attempt to get urgent Latin American and Caribbean action to achieve the following: first, prohibiting the introduction of nuclear weapons into the region; secondly, stopping all aggressive military manoeuvres in the region; thirdly, dis-mantling all foreign military bases that exist in our area; fourthly, ending the colonization of all territories, once and for all; and, fifthly, establishing machinery to deal with all forms of aggression, including assassinations, mercenary invasions, propaganda intervention and diplomatic and economic aggression."
35,1980,GRD,"We agree with the Brandt report's recommendation that ""there must be immediate intervention to attack the root causes of poverty” and again we call for speedy and meaningful implementation of those policies."
35,1980,SYC,"It is in application of these same principles relating to the right of a people to self-determination and the building of its future in peace and security that the Republic of Seychelles supports the people of East Timor in their struggle against the Indonesian occupation and for the independence of their country; that we call for the Afghan people, under the leadership of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, to be able to manage their own affairs and define their own future without being threatened either in terms of their sovereignty or on their frontiers and with the assistance of allies which they choose; that we hope that Iran, like all other States, will make arrangements to engender respect for international law with regard to the immunity of diplomatic personnel, although, at the same time, there should be an international convention protecting peoples and States against the activities of certain shady foreigners who contrive to obtain diplomatic status to carry out their often clandestine work, particularly in third world countries; that we demand that a halt be called to the repression against the peoples of Chile, Bolivia and El Salvador and that any and all threats of foreign military intervention in El Salvador should be eliminated."
35,1980,BRB,"The Charter provides for non-intervention in the internal affairs of States, yet the Soviet Union persists in the occupation of Afghanistan."
35,1980,HND,"Once again we are encountering an area of tension in which foreign intervention in the internal affairs of a country threatens to engender a conflict of more serious proportions which, unfortunately, might successively involve the great Powers."
35,1980,CUB,"The policies and principles of the movement of non- aligned countries have always been primarily aimed at the conservation of the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of our peoples; the elimination of interference and foreign intervention in the internal and external affairs of States and of the use or threat of the use of force; the elimination of colonialism and neo-colonialism, apartheid, racism, including Zionism; the prevention of the division of the world into blocs; the halting of the arms race, especially of nuclear arms and achievement of general and complete disarmament under effective international control; the promotion of solidarity and co-operation among the non-aligned countries; the speedy establishment of the new international economic order with a view to speeding up the development of developing countries, eliminating inequality, hunger, sickness and illiteracy; the establishment of a democratic system of international relations based on the equality of States; respect for and preservation of human rights and fundamental freedoms, If these objectives are to be attained, our movement considers that it is necessary to strengthen our world Organization."

35,1980,SEN,"The Kampuchean people must exercise its right to complete independence, without foreign occupation or intervention."
35,1980,NOR,In the last part of my intervention I shall state the position of my Government on some of the principal issues on our agenda.
35,1980,NIC,"As we have already said on many occasions, we wish to maintain the best possible relations with the United States, and we are willing to continue to make whatever effort is necessary to heal the wounds which still exist among our people as a result of the policies of intervention and of complicity with tyranny which, until only a short time ago, were dominant."
35,1980,NIC,"Failure to ratify the SALT II treaty, manoeuvres by naval forces, the supply of weapons to reactionary Governments and military intervention by major Powers against countries in the Middle East and Indo-China further increase international tension and endanger world peace."
35,1980,NIC,We warn the world that outside intervention in El Salvador would involve a spreading of the conflict- to the entire central American area.
35,1980,NIC,"Nicaragua does not intervene in the internal affairs of its neighbours, and we reject the ill-intentioned accusations which are levelled at us in this respect with the sole aim of disguising or justifying the intervention of those who have been intervening since the last century, as the history of Nicaragua shows."
35,1980,NIC,"American peace forces, because they are merely new forms of intervention and new weapons for use against peoples."
35,1980,NIC,"The Nicaraguan revolution stands with the peoples fighting for their liberation, and we wish to issue an appeal to the international community to increase its efforts to win respect for the principle of non-intervention and self- determination of peoples as an indispensable condition for the peace which the peoples of the world desire."
35,1980,CHN,"In other words, the Soviet Union may, under the pretext of fulfilling its ""internationalist obligations"", carry out armed intervention in other countries at will."
35,1980,CHN,"The aim of the Soviet Union is to legitimize the Afghan regime it has installed through military intervention and to confuse the public so that the crux of the Afghan question would appear to be a matter of relations between Afghanistan and its neighbouring countries, and not one of Soviet armed aggression."
35,1980,NLD,"The Soviet intervention in Afghanistan has been a cause of deep concern to my Government, and we have expressed this concern on more than one occasion."
35,1980,NLD,The effect of the intervention has been a human tragedy for the Afghan people in terms of casualties and of hundreds of thousands of refugees in neighbouring countries.
35,1980,MDV,"The questions of world peace, disarmament, the prevention of aggression by one State against another, the elimination of intervention in the internal affairs of one State by another and the settlement of international conflicts by peaceful means, cannot be solved without the political will of the super-Powers."
35,1980,MDV,"It is our view that the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of countries should be upheld, even when moral, national or other justifications may tempt some of us to violate it."
35,1980,MDV,"The key to the solution of the problems in the region, we believe, is the removal of the elements of intervention, including the withdrawal of foreign troops and the abandonment of schemes to install and strengthen foreign military bases."
35,1980,VNM,"Looking back at the situation in Southeast Asia over the past 35 years, one finds it crystal clear that the lack of peace and security in this region stems from the policies of aggression and intervention of the imperialist forces and of the hegemonism of a country which styles itself as the centre of the world."
35,1980,VNM,"The fundamental task today in restoring peace and stability in Southeast Asia is to halt the policy of aggression, intervention and threats of war by the expansionists, in collusion with imperialism, against the national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Southeast Asian countries."
35,1980,VNM,"We demand that the United States renounce its attempts to annex the Micronesian islands, withdraw its troops from South Korea and end its collusion with the expansionists who wish to perpetuate the division of Korea, and desist from its policy of aggression, intervention and subversion against the peoples of Afghanistan, Iran and the countries of the Indian subcontinent."
35,1980,VNM,We highly value the wide-ranging aid accorded by the Soviet Union to the Afghan people and Government to help them stand up to the attempts at aggression and acts of intervention and subversion on the part of the forces of imperialism and international reaction.
35,1980,VNM,"As in other regions of the world, the policy of aggression, intervention and threat of the use of force on the part of imperialism, in collusion with international reaction, constitutes the most dangerous threat to national independence, peace and stability in Central America and in the Caribbean region."
35,1980,VNM,"Equally, we staunchly support the struggle of the people of Panama to exercise total sovereignty over the Canal Zone; that of the people of Jamaica against imperialistic attempts at subversion and intervention; that of the Chilean people against the Pinochet Fascist junta; and that of the peoples of Puerto Rico and Belize against imperialist domination and for their right to self-determination and independence."
35,1980,VNM,"In particular, the Vietnamese people would like to express its solidarity with the struggle of the people and the Revolutionary Democratic Front of El Salvador against the Fascist regime of the military clique in power and against the threat of imperialist intervention, and for their right to live in freedom and independence and to decide their own destiny."
35,1980,LUX,"Underlying the two conflicts, we find the flagrant violation of the principles contained in our Charter, which is the basis of our Organization, that is the right of peoples to self-determination and the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of another State."
35,1980,ARE,The Gulf region is confronted with increasing foreign threats of intervention in its affairs on the pretext of protection.
35,1980,LBY,"Everyone is aware of the deteriorating situation on the African continent resulting from the continuing imperialist intervention in the affairs of some African States, the war waged against the liberal and progressive regimes, the creation of weak subordinate entities, and the existence of the racist regime in southern Africa, with its repeated attacks on the people of the continent, its disregard for human rights and its persistence in violating the principles of the Charter and pursuing its racist policy."
35,1980,LBY,"The situation in Central America is becoming increasingly dangerous and explosive, particularly in El Salvador, where the United States is engaged in open intervention in the internal affairs of a small country with the purpose not only of terrorizing the people of El Salvador but, ultimately, all the peoples of the entire region."
35,1980,OMN,"Recently we witnessed a dangerous phenomenon in the international arena: the intervention of a major Power in the internal affairs of a small country, to the point of using armed force, invading small countries and overthrowing their lawful regimes."
35,1980,OMN,"Following Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan, Oman joined 51 other States in calling for an emergency meeting of the Security Council to deal with that intervention."
35,1980,OMN,"At that session a resolution was adopted by an overwhelming majority calling for the immediate, unconditional and total withdrawal of the foreign forces from Afghanistan in order to enable its people to determine their own form of government and choose their economic, political and social systems free from outside intervention, subversion, coercion or constraint of any kind whatsoever."
35,1980,OMN,"The international community must put an end to this dangerous phenomenon, so that other small States will not be victims of military intervention by a major Power aimed at overthrowing the regimes in authority and at controlling their destiny."
35,1980,OMN,"Because of its geographical position and historical ties with African countries and peoples, Oman must express its concern at the foreign intervention in the Horn of Africa and urge that it be ended."
35,1980,OMN,It is opposed to any action likely to hamper shipping and to lead to foreign intervention in our area.
35,1980,NPL,"As we all know, this grave situation has arisen as a result of armed intervention in those two nonaligned countries."
35,1980,NPL,"I must submit that even the plea of self-defence and security does not justify armed intervention, much less continued occupation by armed forces of other States."
35,1980,VEN,"Those principles include non-intervention, collective security, the self-determination of peoples, respect for human rights and permanent sovereignty over natural resources— to mention only some."
35,1980,STP,Kurt Waldheim on the persistent efforts which he has made to implement our decisions and on his relentless search for viable solutions to the delicate and complex problems that require his constant intervention.
35,1980,MMR,"This is frequently evident in the increasing recourse to force, military intervention and interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States, as well as in the undermining of international norms and principles which have long governed the conduct of relations between States."
35,1980,MMR,The firm and consistent policy of Burma is that it cannot condone the employment of armed intervention by an outside foreign Power in the internal affairs of another independent sovereign State to bring about a change in the Government of that State.
35,1980,TGO,Our Organization should reaffirm the immutable principle of non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of each and every State.
35,1980,BHR,"Such relations should be based on respect for the principles of the Charter, particularly mutual respect among States for each other's independence, sovereignty, integrity and security and the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States."
35,1980,BHR,"We have explained on more than one occasion that we are against all kinds of pressure and all forms of intervention in the domestic affairs of States and all acts of aggression, whether from East or West."
35,1980,BHR,"We consider that calm and peace will return to Afghanistan only upon the complete withdrawal of all foreign forces from Afghanistan, through respect for its sovereignty and integrity as a non-aligned country and non-intervention in its domestic affairs, and only if the people of Afghanistan are allowed to determine for themselves their form of government and their economic, political and social system, without foreign interference."
35,1980,PAN,"Only six weeks ago, the Permanent Council of the Organization of American States, in resolution 308 (432/80) of 25 July 1980, on solidarity with the Bolivian people, in referring to the right of every State freely to develop its cultural, political and economic life and at the same time to the duty of the State to respect the rights of the human person and the principles of universal morality, specifically stated that this principle specifically embodied in article 16 of the charter of the Organization of American States was violated by the military coup that took place in Bolivia, when the elections recently held in that country, in strict respect for the principle of non-intervention, were set aside."
35,1980,TUR,We believe that a political settlement of the crisis in Kampuchea should enable the people of Kampuchea to choose their own Government without outside intervention or coercion.
05,1950,RUS,"Those decisions were intended to camouflage the armed intervention in Korea which, as we know, was begun even before the Security Council had adopted its resolution of 27 June 1950."
05,1950,GRC,"That is why the intervention of the United Nations in Korea, which moreover proved that there exists a decisive world leadership, today raises the hopes and the confidence of all peoples really devoted to peace."
05,1950,CHL,"No one can believe that the Soviet Union is serious in proposing to the General Assembly that the powers and responsibilities of the Security Council for the maintenance of peace should be strengthened, because everybody knows that it has never been possible and never will be possible for the Security Council to take any decision involving intervention in a situation in which the USSR is either directly or indirectly concerned."
05,1950,LBN,The intervention of the Trusteeship Council and the injunctions of its President have been of no avail.
05,1950,BLR,"We must demand the immediate cessation of intervention in Korea and settle the Korean question by peaceful means, giving the Korean people itself an opportunity of deciding its own fate."
05,1950,BLR,"Every day the postal and the telegraph services bring to the United Nations telegrams and letters from all corners of the globe, from simple people of all nationalities and of all creeds, who beg the United Nations to outlaw the atomic bomb, to put an end to the race for armaments, to put an end to the intervention in Korea and to conclude a peace pact between the five great Powers."
05,1950,BLR,The Korean people know very well who organized the intervention in Korea.
05,1950,SWE,"It implies that the war in Korea is a civil war, and that an intervention in the fight between different Korean Forces is a violation of Article 2 (7) of the United Nations Charter."
05,1950,SWE,"I should like to point out that the interpretation of Article 2 (7), as presented by the representative of the Soviet Union, would mean that : the United Nations Charter had raised to a legal principle the policy of non-intervention that was followed by most countries during the Spanish Civil War."
05,1950,SWE,In particular it has been stressed that the United States decided upon intervention before the Security Council had considered the question.
05,1950,ARG,"Respect for the sovereignty and equality of states, non-intervention in domestic matters, improvement of legal principles, economic development and social progress, must be the main objectives of our discussions."
05,1950,ISR,"It is the sources of discontent, strife, rebellion and armed intervention that must be eliminated."
05,1950,DOM,I belong to a country whose deepest and most prolonged historical afflictions have been painfully rooted in the most varied types of intervention.
05,1950,DOM,"The Dominican Republic, with its experience of the martyrdom of intervention, is in a position to appreciate to the full the tragedy which the people of South Korea is suffering."
05,1950,POL,"Contrary to the principles of the Charter, the majority of Members of the United Nations has sanctioned intervention in the internal affairs of other States."
05,1950,POL,"But at the same time as that refusal, items were being placed on the agenda that were aimed at patent intervention in the domestic affairs of States in which popular governments, called to power by the liberated peoples of those countries, had been constituted."
05,1950,POL,"Those very same people, or their predecessors in power, directed the intervention in 1918, 1919 and 1920 against the peoples of Russia liberated by the revolution."
05,1950,POL,"A similar attempt to alter the course of history is the armed intervention in Korea, which is being carried out illegally under the banner of the United Nations."
05,1950,YUG,The extraordinary bitterness and fury with which this anti-Yugoslav campaign is being waged shows that we are faced here both with a tendency to impose foreign hegemony upon an independent country and an attempt at reactionary intervention designed to silence a free people which demand equal and democratic relations among nations and especially among countries which claim to be socialist; to silence a free people who are blazing the trail for the further development of social democracy and are rejecting attempts to have methods of bureaucratic despotism imposed upon them from abroad.
05,1950,SLV,"However, the development of events during the past five years, since the middle of 1945, has made it abundantly clear, whether it be in the case of Greece or China or Korea, that the small nations always support good causes, because it is in defending the fundamental principles of the United Nations, such as the equality of rights of States, self-determination and non-intervention, that the materially less powerful States most effectively safeguard their own political stability."
05,1950,SLV,"We are accustomed by now to the lack of co-operation shown in previous cases and even to the Soviet Union’s boycott of important recommendations of the General Assembly, such as those which established the United Nations Special Committee on the Balkans, intended to help Greece against foreign intervention, or the United Nations Commission on Korea, established to help restore the country’s unity and organize it as a free State."
05,1950,LBR,"In spite of the propaganda which has been launched against the actions taken in Korea, it must be admitted, after a careful study of all the facts and circumstances in the case, that there was no other alternative left to the United Nations but forceful intervention in order to compel compliance with its commands issued to the Government of North Korea for the immediate withdrawal of all its military and armed forces to the 38th parallel."
05,1950,CSK,"If a just and democratic settlement of this matter is to be achieved, the sovereign will of the Korean people must be respected, the bombing of Korean towns and villages must cease and the forces of occupation and intervention must be withdrawn from Korea."
05,1950,CHN,"On 6 August the official Soviet daily Izvestia elaborated on this theory of civil war in the following words: “Among the fundamental principles of international law, which regulate foreign policy relations between states, a principle that has gained universal acceptance in the inadmissibility of foreign intervention in the internal affairs of states."
05,1950,CHN,"Contemporary international law views such intervention, in the form of an attack by one state on another, as a heinous international crime… There has never been a question of regarding a struggle within one state, a civil war, an internal conflict, as aggression."
05,1950,CHN,"Conversely, intervention by foreign states in internal conflicts, in civil wars in any country whatsoever, has invariably been designated as a typical manifestation of aggression."
05,1950,CHN,"Russian and communist preparation and intervention in the internal affairs in all free and democratic countries make of every civil war, in which the communists constitute one of the two fighting parties, an aggression threatening the peace and security of the world."
05,1950,CUB,"If the Council’s resolutions of 25 and 27 June had been vetoed, what would the situation in Korea be today? There could have been no intervention in the name of the United Nations against this brutal and unjustified aggression by North Korea, and South Korea would have been completely subjected to the rule of the invaders."
05,1950,CUB,"Or else there would have been intervention of all kinds, but at the risk of charges of a violation, if not of the spirit, at least of the letter of the Charter."
05,1950,BOL,Wherever we look we see evidence of underground activity and the disguised intervention of the person who hides the hand that throws the stone.
05,1950,BOL,"The first idea which occurs to me is that, just as in earlier times, when their domestic jurisdiction was respected, the sovereign States signed pacts of nonaggression, in order, for example, to guarantee peace, it might now be necessary for us to begin considering the preparation of a new multilateral instrument to combat the new political phenomenon, an instrument which would take the form of a universal pact of nonintervention based on the provision in international law which permits collective action to prevent intervention; such collective action would be entrusted to the United Nations, so that President Truman’s doctrine might be further strengthened."
06,1951,PRY,"In the light of the flagrant case of the aggression against the Korean Republic and the subsequent intervention of the Peiping Government in the conflict, it is clearly necessary first, by legal and technical means, to use the collective security machinery provided for in the Charter, and secondly, by practical measures, to organize a better defence of a world that seeks to live in peace and to banish the danger of new aggressions."
06,1951,EGY,"Our colleague concluded his intervention in this respect by donning clerical robes, piously praying for Article 1 of the Charter, and asking God Almighty to preserve this world of ours from becoming an international jungle."
06,1951,EGY,"It was no surprise to any of us that the representative of the United Kingdom readily subscribed to the intervention of his associate from the South Pacific, briefly pointing, in his turn, to the respect for the sanctity of treaties as an obligation which hinds all States both small as well as great."
06,1951,EGY,For seventy years Egypt has been trying to correct the situation and get rid of British intervention in the Nile Valley.
06,1951,UKR,"The United Nations has approved and sanctioned the intervention of the United States of America in Korea and, under pressure from that country, is helping to extend that aggression."
06,1951,SYR,"Instead of doing so, they overlooked the Egyptian crisis and the Palestine catastrophe, with its refugees, and proceeded to draft a kind of intervention in Arab domestic affairs impinging on their sovereign rights."
06,1951,SYR,"I remind him now that it was not the attack of the Arab States on Palestine which caused the crisis of the Arab refugees, because the Arab refugees were expelled from Palestine before the intervention of the Arabs months before that."
06,1951,SYR,"This was the first intervention of the Arab States, while this exodus took place long before, as I have stated; and I think that Mr."
06,1951,SYR,"Shertok remembers very well a discussion in the Security Council which took place before the intervention of the Arab States, during which I stated that the number of refugees from the homes of Arabs amounted at that time to about 400,000; and Sir Alexander Cadogan, representing the Mandatory Power, replied correcting this figure, saying it was not 400,000 but perhaps 300,000 or 250,000 up till then."
06,1951,SYR,Now he says that the intervention of the Arab States after 15 May gave birth to the problem of the Arab refugees.
06,1951,BLR,Armed intervention by American forces in the civil war in Korea continues to this day.
06,1951,BLR,Acheson and his adherents need this talk of North Korean aggression in order to justify intervention by American forces in Korea.
06,1951,CSK,"In its international relations the policy of the Czechoslovak Government is led by the effort to maintain and strengthen peace, to expand and deepen peaceful co-operation among nations on the basis of full respect for their sovereignty, of non-intervention, of the recognition of their equality, and of the maintenance of contractual obligations."
06,1951,BRA,"As an example of those achievements, it is with great satisfaction that the Brazilian delegation, at the opening of the General Assembly’s sixth session, can point to the felicitous intervention of the United Nations in Greece and Korea."
06,1951,ARG,"We believe that development should be sought step by step in keeping with the principle of recognition of the sovereignty of nations, with its corollary of non-intervention."
06,1951,ARG,"Argentina, as a Member of the United Nations and on the basis of the Charter, is guided, as our President has said, by the traditional desire of its people to settle international disputes by pacific means and by respect for equality between individuals and for the sovereignty of the State; we affirm our will to social justice, our repudiation of any form of hegemony, our belief in democratic ideals and in the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of States."
06,1951,HTI,"Francis Biddle, proposed at the time the adoption of an international penal code to define the cases where there might legitimately be intervention on humanitarian grounds for the repression of crimes against the human person, a dictum that had already been advocated by the Viennese school of Hans Kelsen, who maintained that international law was above domestic law."
06,1951,RUS,"Shortly before this sixth session the majority in the Security Council, at the instigation of the United States and England, committed a new violation of the most important principles of the United Nations Charter by accepting for consideration the British complaint against Iran, in clear violation of Article 2, paragraph 7, of the Charter which, as you are aware, forbids intervention in the domestic affairs of States."
06,1951,RUS,Truman - not even in the intervention of Mr.
06,1951,RUS,El-Khoury could not help pointing out that this bears a strong resemblance to preparations for American intervention in the Near East.
06,1951,IRN,Effective intervention by the Organization has prevented the aggravation of international disputes.
49,1994,SLE,We were accused of harbouring ulterior motives against that country and of encouraging intervention.
49,1994,IND,New doctrines justify armed United Nations intervention under circumstances that are not quite defined - not yet at any rate.
49,1994,IND,"If there are circumstances which justify armed multilateral intervention, by the same logic should not the United Nations have the right to enforce the equitable sharing of resources among nations? The Non-aligned Movement, at the meeting of its Foreign Ministers in Cairo this year, suggested some guiding principles for peace-keeping operations of enduring significance."
49,1994,IND,"Peace-keeping operations should strictly adhere to the principles of the Charter, in particular the principles of full respect for the sovereignty of States, their territorial integrity and non-intervention in their internal affairs."
49,1994,LSO,"I need to mention specifically the timely and principled intervention by President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, President Nelson Mandela of South Africa and President Ketumile Masire of Botswana."
49,1994,COD,The current situation in countries bordering Rwanda meets all the preconditions for preventive intervention by the international community.
49,1994,ECU,"Ecuador has advocated a solution to the complex Haitian crisis that takes account of the principles of non- intervention and the peaceful settlement of disputes and that involves the participation of all sectors of Haitian society, with the broadest respect for human rights and taking account of the relevant resolutions of the Organization of American States and of the United Nations."
49,1994,ECU,"As we said earlier, Ecuador attaches very special importance within this process, to the intervention of His Holiness the Pope, in seeking a definitive solution to this problem."
49,1994,SDN,"The recent conflict in the sisterly state of Yemen ended with the victory of constitutional legality, which preserved the unity of Yemen; this incident should lead us to stress the need to refrain from intervention in the internal affairs of other States that might find themselves in similar circumstances."
49,1994,MCO,"Important world conferences - the one on population and development which has just concluded in Cairo, the one on social development scheduled for Copenhagen in March next year, or the Fourth World Conference on Women, which will take place in September 1995 in Beijing - have been and will be opportunities to intensify our thinking and build up our means of intervention in key areas for the future."
49,1994,ATG,"In each of the countries where the Security Council took action, there was clearly a need for humanitarian intervention."
49,1994,ATG,"Therefore, it is my view that the nations of the world should amend the Charter of the Organization to confer power on the United Nations to intervene in cases where humanitarian intervention is warranted."
49,1994,ATG,"As co-Chairman of the Commission on Universal Governance, Sir Shridath Ramphal said recently: “An activist United Nations will not long survive as a legitimate andeffective actor if it is used simply as a cover for the intervention of major Powers."
49,1994,ATG,"Above all, intervention should not be unduly influenced, much less determined, by the interests or domestic political agendas of powerful nations acting within a region or globally."
49,1994,ATG,"” In this connection, and particularly if we pursue the notion of amending the Charter to provide for United Nations-authorized humanitarian intervention, the membership of the Security Council itself must be revisited to change the anachronistic nature of the Council and make it more representative of the nations of the world."
49,1994,MDG,Those United Nations missions that were to some extent successful benefitted from the following factors: broad support from the international community; the consent of the parties to the dispute; and non-violent and impartial intervention forces.
49,1994,DOM,"Cooperation is the alternative to intervention, the way to fulfil the international community’s desires for peace, stability and democracy."
49,1994,LUX,Does international law authorize the United Nations to intervene within a country? Does not the Charter assert the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of a State? I welcome the fact that for some time now the international community has been treating that principle in a more flexible way.
49,1994,BEN,Hence there is a balance to be struck between intervention and respect for the sovereignty of States.
49,1994,TUR,"Compliance with the basic international norms - respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-intervention in internal affairs, and the need to resolve disputes by peaceful means rather than by threat or coercion - is today more than ever before a pressing need in the Balkans."
49,1994,GRC,"The strengthening of good-neighbourly relations on the basis of respect for international law, national sovereignty, human rights and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States is the cornerstone of Greek foreign policy."
49,1994,URY,It is indeed appropriate to enunciate these principles: prohibition of the use of force against the territorial integrity and the independence of States; equality of rights and free self-determination; the duty of non-intervention in internal affairs - a principle that is clearly of Latin American origin; the sovereign equality of States; the peaceful settlement of disputes and good-faith cooperation among nations.
49,1994,URY,"6   These principles are part of a whole, and they must not yield to possible distortions, one of which calls for change on the grounds that the world context has changed, leading to the justification of intervention on humanitarian grounds, and another of which is embodied in the temptation to exaggerate some of these principles to the detriment of others, for example invoking self-determination as a pretext for violating the territorial integrity or national borders of other States."
49,1994,URY,"Our participation has been based on a number of fundamental principles that govern our foreign policy, namely, non-intervention in internal affairs, peaceful settlement of disputes, self-determination of peoples, and non-use of force to achieve peace."
49,1994,URY,"We in the American hemisphere believe that the Cuban situation must be seen in the light of two considerations: on the one hand, the view - shared by our country - that pluralist and representative democracy and the protection of human rights must be fully consolidated in our continent without any exceptions; and, on the other, the perspective of respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter regarding non-intervention and the self-determination of peoples."
49,1994,URY,Our country has invariably opposed any kind of military intervention lacking the necessary legal support.
49,1994,ERI,This regional effort has complemented and acted as a vital linkage to international intervention at a number of crucial junctures.
49,1994,ALB,The military intervention Serbia perpetrated in order to halt more secessions from the federation would have been avoided if the new Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina had been placed under the firm protection of the United Nations.
49,1994,ALB,"As we said last year, we are in favor favor of United Nations intervention wherever there are clear signs, as determined by early-warning monitoring, of a threat of human catastrophe."
49,1994,ALB,We hold that in such cases there is no reason for the Security Council to hesitate to take a decision on intervention without the prior consent of the State or Government that is the cause of and is responsible for the catastrophe.
49,1994,COL,"Cooperation, as an alternative to intervention, is the route that can ensure for the community of nations the fulfilment of its aspirations for peace and stability."
49,1994,VNM,The tendency to resort more and more to measures of enforcement and intervention to try to resolve intra-State conflicts has prompted legitimate concern among many countries.
49,1994,CAN,"Too often, the intervention of the United Nations comes too late, is too slow and is carried out under inadequate conditions."
49,1994,CAN,"Thirdly, we must strengthen the rapid-intervention capability of the United Nations."
49,1994,CAN,"As we now fully realize, rapid deployment of intervention forces is essential."
49,1994,HND,"Indeed, there has been a marked increase in recourse to the United Nations as an instrument to prevent, avert or halt international conflicts, and in order to legitimize the right of intervention in the case of conflict between a State and its population or a State and the international community - but always in search of peace, freedom and democracy."
49,1994,HND,"In this context, we reaffirm our fullest support for the joint initiatives, which are based on the principles of representative democracy, the defence and promotion of human rights, respect for sovereignty and the principles of non-intervention and the self-determination of peoples."
49,1994,GNQ,"We believe that the escalation of domestic tensions in many African countries today has a common cause: political intolerance, fuelled and promoted by foreign intervention in a country's domestic jurisdiction."
49,1994,DJI,"Its strong In Haiti, the long-anticipated international intervention, sanctioned in Security Council resolution 940 (1994), has taken place."
49,1994,DJI,"In place of classic peace-keeping, we will witness a growing reliance upon ad hoc multinational intervention, the so-called posse response, but that too has 27   its limitations - for we are concerned with whether there is to be meaningful collective security."
49,1994,SUR,"The significant efforts made by the United Nations and the Organization of American States, including the various resolutions adopted, the missions sent to Haiti and the threat of an immediate military intervention, have finally convinced the military leadership to step down not later than 15 October."
49,1994,MRT,The operation was a model of proper and disinterested humanitarian intervention.
49,1994,CHL,"The central role of this Organization must be strengthened and supported in the crucial years that lie ahead, for this is the only way to ensure that the settlement of conflicts does not alter international legality, that arbitrary intervention is prevented and that the rights of the weakest are respected."
49,1994,GBR,"The issue was not really whether the United Nations should have sent an intervention force to stop the fighting - which it clearly could not - but whether it could find the means, the men and the equipment, for a force to protect the civilian population."
49,1994,GBR,"It is not now, it seems to me, a question of will, because there is a far greater readiness than there used to be to contemplate intervention on the ground to mitigate or prevent humanitarian disaster."
49,1994,GBR,The physical capacity also needs to be strengthened if intervention is to be rapid when it is needed.
49,1994,KOR,Continued efforts should also be made to address the modality of intervention and the means of securing the necessary resources.
49,1994,MDV,The inherent vulnerability of small States was never more clearly demonstrated than it was in the case of the international intervention in Kuwait in 1990.
49,1994,PRY,"Paraguay actively participated in producing the declaration in regard to the fraternal Republic of Cuba, which expresses the strong hope that it will introduce significant political and economic reforms in accordance with the people's will, and stating that we respect the self-determination of peoples and the principle of non-intervention."
49,1994,BTN,"All countries are working hard to translate the commitments into action, but the resources available are insufficient for effective and lasting intervention."
49,1994,TUN,"Hence the major responsibility devolving on the United Nations to assist the machinery, by providing the funds for peace deriving from the Organization, as well as necessary means for the success of such intervention."
49,1994,TUN,"""In this respect, one of the object lessons to be learnt from the events in Rwanda is that it is imperative that the review of the United Nations Security Council's methods of work be expedited and that the necessary measures to deal with the problem of procrastination that has been noted in the implementation of United Nations resolutions be taken with the speed and diligence required in dealing with international crisis situations so that United Nations intervention may be effective and timely."
49,1994,IDN,The pleas of the Bosnian Government for effective international intervention or at least the lifting of the ill-conceived arms embargo have gone unheeded.
49,1994,DEU,"But aggressors must also realize that the United Nations is capable of military intervention where other means of achieving the aims of the Charter have failed, and that it has the will to take such action."
49,1994,HRV,"Croatia proposes the provision of a permanent peace- keeping task force for the intervention requirements of the Security Council, involving special military units made available, through agreement with a specific number of countries for Security Council requirements."
49,1994,ITA,"In the wake of the crisis in Rwanda, my Government is promoting the establishment of a task force for rapid intervention in humanitarian emergencies."
49,1994,CMR,"In relations between States, the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of States must be respected, while at the same time this should not be an obstacle to mutual cooperation in the event of natural disasters and calamities that require humanitarian intervention."
49,1994,IRL,"And this, I believe, is the central question facing the United Nations as it approaches its fiftieth anniversary: can the United Nations, which was born out of the greatest inter-State conflict the world has ever seen, and which is designed specifically to prevent and resolve such conflicts - can this Organization deal adequately with internal crises and civil strife? I know that there are some who argue that the United Nations has no place in such matters, that many internal conflicts are not amenable to outside intervention."
49,1994,IRL,We must develop the Organization’s capacity for early warning and mediation and for timely intervention in disputes before they escalate out of control.
49,1994,GHA,"We must not undermine the validity of the basic principles of the Organization, such as the sovereign equality of States and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States."
49,1994,SMR,The excessive crises and wars that have recently and suddenly broken out and the revival and intensification of old ones in too many parts of our planet call for the involvement and intervention of the international community.
49,1994,SMR,"Let me also stress that not only should such intervention be firm, but it should also be legitimate and correct."
49,1994,BRA,We consider it disturbing that the principles of non-intervention and self-determination are the object of interpretations that are incompatible with the charters of the United Nations and of the Organization of American States.
49,1994,BRA,"We have based our positions on respect for principles such as non-intervention, as well as on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States; we have consistently favoured peaceful and negotiated solutions to conflicts, as well as consensus; we have stood by the rule of law in safeguarding the international public order; we have risen 4   in defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms; and we have increasingly participated in peace-keeping operations in several regions of the globe."
49,1994,CAF,"In this context, firmly convinced of the importance of humanitarian action in Rwanda, we supported unhesitatingly the helpful intervention of France, whose courage and determination we extol."
49,1994,CAF,That intervention curbed human suffering and restored peace to Rwanda.
49,1994,CAF,"Bill Clinton, President of the United States of America, and to the American people for their intervention in Haiti aimed at restoring democracy and returning the democratically elected President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to office."
49,1994,CAF,"It is only if these legal instruments are established that the so-called poor countries will be able to begin to lay the foundations of their economic, social and cultural development in peace and tranquillity and 2   that the intervention of the international community and the wealthy countries will be only complementary."
49,1994,PRT,"That very positive evolution contrasts even more strongly with such shocking situations as that of Haiti, a country where conditions are being created for the re-establishment of democratic constitutional order following the intervention of a multinational force authorized by the United Nations Security Council."
49,1994,MYS,"While the situation in Somalia clearly reflected the need for some form of United Nations involvement, if not intervention, there have been other operations where even countries in the region have been totally opposed to United Nations involvement."
49,1994,MYS,"However, many of us will not be willing to agree that these Powers should continue to be Charter-privileged to intervene wherever they wish and only when their own interpretations of peace and security warrant intervention."
49,1994,QAT,"The most important underpinnings on which this new order must rest are, in our view, respect for the principles and purposes of the United Nations and its Charter, in particular, the principle of sovereign co- equality, the willingness of States to honour their commitments in good faith, non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States, the control by States of their natural resources, the non-use and the absence of the threat of the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of other States, and the resolution of international disputes by peaceful means in accordance with the principles of international law through mediation, dialogue or through the International Court of Justice."
49,1994,QAT,"We believe that the security of the region requires cooperation amongst all its States on the basis of good- neighbourliness, mutual respect, non-intervention in internal affairs and respect for international law."
49,1994,MUS,"Given the lack of action during the first few days, we welcomed France’s intervention for strictly humanitarian purposes, which allowed numerous lives to be saved."
49,1994,ARG,"In Haiti, the overall solution lies in compliance with Security Council resolution 940 (1994), which, within the system of collective security provided for in the Charter, authorizes multilateral action, a mechanism that is essentially different in nature from unilateral intervention, which we reject."
49,1994,VEN,"Amongst these values are the self- determination of nations and non-intervention, as laid down in the Preamble to our Constitution."
49,1994,VEN,"For the same reason, though, Venezuela did not support military intervention in Haiti, despite the fact that the United Nations has lent it multilateral and institutional support."
49,1994,SLV,"Our Government welcomes the last-minute solution reached by the United States and the de facto government of Haiti, which made it possible to avoid a major armed intervention that would have greatly harmed the Haitian people."
49,1994,BDI,"With regard to the crisis in Somalia, we know it was the massive intervention of the Blue Helmets that led the parties involved to the negotiating table."
49,1994,TJK,"The wounds of the civil war, that serious illness of our society, cannot be healed either by surgical intervention or by compulsory treatment."
49,1994,CUB,"How, then, can we trust them to promote democracy in the future? Cuba has always supported and promoted efforts to restore the constitutional order in Haiti with the unconditional and unrestricted return of President Aristide and has rejected the attempts to resort to foreign intervention as a means of resolving the conflict."
49,1994,CUB,"These are examples of the Security Council's illegitimate foray into areas beyond its mandate: intervention based on vague arguments of humanitarian protection, or the authorizing of one or several States to take unilateral punitive actions, under Chapter VII of the Charter, in operations of invasion, occupation and intervention."
49,1994,KHM,We congratulate the international community for its intervention in Rwanda and we are pleased to see that the situation is now stabilized.
49,1994,LKA,"Yet we must continue to reiterate that foresight and careful assessment are vital in the preparation for any Council intervention, and that such action should be pursued only with the consent and cooperation of the States concerned."
62,2007,SLB,"However disguised and rationalized, intervention  and occupation allow assisting nations to spend and  earn substantial revenue for their supporting businesses  and industries."
62,2007,SLB,Our experience  with the Australian-designed cooperative intervention  package demonstrates the need for greater United  Nations involvement in the leadership of future  regional peacekeeping operations.
62,2007,PLW,"We would  welcome the intervention and assistance of our  partners, as well as the recommitment of the Secretariat  to our original shared goals."
62,2007,CYP,"Despite declaratory remarks of  willingness to solve the Cyprus problem, its actions  confirm its dedication to its ab initio pursuit of  controlling Cyprus by partitioning it geographically  into two ethnically clean parts, with Turkey securing  rights of suzerainty and the â€œrightâ€ of intervention in  Cyprus."
62,2007,CYP,The  Cyprus problem is caused by not bad community  relations but by outside intervention.
62,2007,YEM,"As has  always been the case, the Republic of Yemen will  remain a partner in the reconciliation process,  supporting all the parties, rejecting any foreign  intervention in Somalia and emphasizing the need for  reconstruction in Somalia, with a view to enabling the  Transitional Federal Government to rebuild State  institutions."
62,2007,BDI,"In this context, we must all agree and decide to  make our Organization more operational, more  pragmatic, more democratic and capable of fulfilling  its mission, a mission that is to be accomplished in full  cooperation with the regional organizations whose  effectiveness in the area of conflict prevention and  intervention is well known, despite often insufficient  resources."
62,2007,TLS,"The then President  of the Republic, the Speaker of the National Parliament  and the Prime Minister jointly agreed to seek the  United Nations urgent assistance and the rapid  intervention of friendly countries."
62,2007,TLS,"There was violence in a number  of locations in which local law enforcement elements  were implicated, but the swift intervention of the  United Nations police and the International  Stabilization Force (ISF) succeeded in quickly  controlling the situation."
62,2007,GBR,"Military  intervention is never the whole solution, but sometimes  a solution cannot be found without armed force."
62,2007,SYR,"We believe that the run-up to the coming  presidential elections constitutes a good basis for  consensus-building among the Lebanese to elect a  president in accordance with constitutional rules, free  from foreign intervention and in a manner that would  safeguard Lebanon’s interests and its relations with  Arab countries."
62,2007,PSE,They demand  rapid intervention from the international community  with the aim of settling this situation boldly and  without delay.
62,2007,SMR,"At the same time, the small  countries are intensifying their contacts within the  United Nations to adopt further joint intervention  programmes, mainly of a humanitarian character."
62,2007,SMR,"To achieve these objectives, which were also  among the main issues included in the programme of  the recent chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers  of the Council of Europe, my country has launched  some awareness raising and effective intervention  campaigns, such as the campaign on violence against  women and in favour of children’s rights."
62,2007,GNQ,"Ban Ki- moon, who deserves our full support so that United  Nations intervention can be effective in conflicts and  situations threatening peace, stability and the well- being of nations."
62,2007,URY,"The Eastern Republic of Uruguay would like to  begin by reiterating its ongoing commitment to the  principles and guidelines which are and will continue  to be at the very core of its international activity: the  sovereign equality of States, the rejection of the use of  force or the threat of the use of force, peaceful  settlement of international disputes, attachment to and  support for institutions of international law, support for  international law itself, non-intervention in the internal  affairs of other States, the self-determination of  peoples, the promotion of human rights, international  cooperation in economic and social matters, and  support for multilateralism and for the quest for  collective answers based on consensus and respect for  law, and within the framework of the principles of the  United Nations Charter   which means the rejection  of any attempt to impose the will of one State over that  of others."
62,2007,ZAF,A similar intervention  helped to put a number of Asian countries on their own  development trajectory.
62,2007,NER,"The United Nations Ten-year Capacity-Building  Programme for the African Union is to be commended,  as it opens new possibilities for conflict prevention and  the maintenance of lasting peace on the continent, in  particular through the creation of an African  intervention force."
62,2007,LBN,"That is why we urge the international community,  through its commitment to the Charter of the United  Nations, to stop foreign intervention in the domestic  affairs of Member States."
62,2007,CUB,"Aggression and illegal occupation of countries,  military intervention contrary to international law and  the purposes and principles enshrined in the United  Nations Charter, the bombing of civilians and torture  continue to be daily practices."
63,2008,URY,"For that reason, we believe it important at the  outset to reassert the validity of those principles in the  present international context and to emphasize once  again the traditional Uruguayan position of full respect  for international law, support for multilateralism,  peaceful settlement of disputes, sovereign equality of  States, rejection of the use or threat of use of force,  non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States,  the self-determination of peoples, the promotion and  protection of human rights and international economic  and social cooperation."
63,2008,AUS,The quantum of government intervention in  financial markets has been significant.
63,2008,FJI,"On 5 December 2006, a political transition took  place in Fiji following an intervention from the Fiji  Military Forces."
63,2008,IDN,"Of the issues that the Council has failed to  resolve, two are of great concern to Indonesia, namely,  those recent cases that directly infringe on the principle  of the territorial integrity and political independence of  States, both involving external intervention that led to  the secession of a part or parts of a State."
63,2008,ARG,"Quite the contrary, we consider this an historic  opportunity to review behaviour and policies, because  during the period of the Washington Consensus, we —  the countries of South America — were told that the  market would solve everything, that the State was not  necessary, that State intervention was something for  which groups that had not understood how the  economy had developed were nostalgic."
63,2008,ARG,"However, now  we are seeing the most formidable State intervention in  memory from exactly the place where we had been told  that the State was not necessary, in the framework,  moreover, of an incredible fiscal and trade deficit."
63,2008,SLV,I would like to finalize my intervention as the  President of El Salvador in this forum.
63,2008,LKA,"We must accept that the dangers of  climate change are man-made and that its solutions,  too, require man’s intervention."
63,2008,BOL,They do not want the military intervention  of any country in any part of the world.
63,2008,PER,That approach guided Peruvian participation on  the Security Council and has led it to reaffirm its  commitment to active participation in peacekeeping  operations in the context of respect for the principles of  the sovereignty of States and non-intervention in the  domestic affairs of other countries.
63,2008,GEO,That was the excuse used by the invader for  what it called a “humanitarian intervention” — a  profound perversion of the responsibility to protect.
63,2008,NIC,"As a country that has fought and continues to  fight for its independence, sovereignty and  self-determination, and as the victim of military and  foreign political intervention several times in its  history, Nicaragua understood early on that there was  no greater value than freedom."
63,2008,CUB,"Wars of conquest, aggression against and the  illegal occupation of countries, military intervention  and the bombing of innocent civilians, the unbridled  arms race, the pillaging and usurpation of the natural  resources of the Third World and the imperial offensive  to crush the resistance of peoples who are defending  their rights constitute the greatest and most serious  threats to international peace and security."
63,2008,CHE,"Nevertheless, Switzerland will commit  to ensuring that the concept is not partially assimilated  into that of humanitarian intervention, thereby calling  into question the consensus achieved in 2005."
63,2008,ECU,"The fight against terrorism cannot be an excuse  for some States to feel released from their obligation to  respect fundamental norms of international law, such as  respect for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity  of other States and non-intervention in their internal  affairs."
63,2008,ECU,"Sovereignty, the inviolability of territory,  the non-use of force and non-intervention in the affairs  of other States are the only guarantee for peaceful  coexistence among the peoples of the world."
63,2008,PRK,"Nevertheless, a vicious circle of aggression and  intervention, conflict and terrorism still persists within  international relations, and, consequently, global peace  and security continue to face serious new challenges."
21,1966,URY,"At the appropriate moment, Uruguay clearly stated that its policy was one of non-intervention and it now confirms that policy."
21,1966,URY,"My Government does not believe that these events provide any reason for changing or qualifying the principle of non-intervention in force in this continent, a principle which was ratified by the General Assembly in its historic resolution 2131 (XX) of 21 December 1965 and one that is not incompatible with international action when such action is legally and politically relevant."
21,1966,URY,"Uruguay wishes to state once again that it is in favour of peace, respect for human rights, the policy of non-intervention and the maximum opportunities for the self-determination of peoples."
21,1966,KWT,"Kuwait condemns all forms of foreign intervention in any part of the world, and particularly in Viet-Nam."
21,1966,KWT,The destruction inflicted on the people of Viet-Nam as a result of this intervention cannot be disregarded by peace-loving countries.
21,1966,NLD,"Even in this very session of the General Assembly committees will be working on the establishment of legal principles in such diverse fields as outer space, human rights, international trade, non-intervention, peaceful coexistence and co-operation and, last but not least, the very foundations of international law, that is, the law governing international treaties."
21,1966,GTM,"We well understand the intolerable situation in which political and legal circumstances, by setting limits on his sphere of action, have placed U Thant, in the face of grave world events calling for intervention by an Organization Which neither acts nor permits him to act."
21,1966,GTM,"There is still another grave factor implicit in the situation, namely, the stand taken thus far by the United Nations in favour of non-intervention in the conflict, of non-confrontation, of refusal even to study, analyse, discuss or pass judgement."
21,1966,GTM,But this argument can also be set aside if United Nations intervention is planned in such a way as precisely to avoid the negative reaction which such intervention might create.
21,1966,GTM,"I wish to refer to the Secretary-General while just briefly mentioning the fourth argument outlined earlier, namely that his personal intervention in the Viet-Namese crisis is limited by the expressed will of the Member States-especially of the great Powers — and that as a result the United Nations cannot and must not intervene in this issue."
21,1966,GTM,"The most that can be said is that United Nations intervention must be cautious, well informed, tactful and prudent."
21,1966,ISR,"Only by establishing peaceful and stable conditions amongst themselves can the States of the Middle East keep the area free from external intervention, such as invariably arises wherever tension grows."
21,1966,ISR,"We have consistently supported resolutions on non-intervention and peaceful coexistence formulated in universal terms as binding on all sovereign States and in all situations, without loopholes or reservations."
21,1966,ITA,My country is proceeding on the assumption that in providing the Organization with the possibility and means of intervention we shall be guaranteeing not only tho security of Member States which lack the material means of guaranteeing their own security — and these are the majority — but also their real independence and freedom.
21,1966,COD,Those events betrayed unequivocal and direct intervention on the part of the People's Republic of China.
21,1966,COD,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo has the legitimate right to live in tranquillity, protected from foreign intervention."
21,1966,CIV,"As far as Viet-Nam is concerned, my country hopes that foreign intervention will cease, whatever its nature or origin."
21,1966,CIV,"That can be accomplished by putting an end to subversive activities in South Viet-Nam, by stopping bombings, intervention and infiltration, by a supervised cessation of hostilities and by returning to the Geneva Conference to solve the problem of unification on the basis of the sacred principle of negotiation and self-determination."
21,1966,PER,"For this reason we have defended and we shall defend the principle of non-intervention, which is not, as one writer has observed, a position of isolation but one of security."
21,1966,PER,The American Republics therefore consider it an outstanding triumph of their legal tradition that the formula of non-intervention adopted by this Assembly last year is in line with the broader scope that they give to this principle.
21,1966,PER,"This concept of respect for the personality of States, and the right of States to develop freely without the intervention or control of any other State, has a special significance at present: the claim that we, the Latin American States, are making for the principle of self-determination and for the right to assistance to counter foreign political activity aimed at disrupting or disturbing the life of our peoples and their idea of competence and authority in domestic affairs."
21,1966,PER,"Peru has given its firmest support to the principle of non-intervention and will unswervingly continue to defend world legal order, based on respect for the personality of States — as formed by the self- determination of peoples — and on faithful compliance with the obligations flowing from international treaties, an unalterable legal order which is laid down in the Charter of the United Nations and supported by the Organization of American States."
21,1966,MDG,"The President of my country recently said that, opposed to any form of armed intervention, he intends to observe on every occasion Ghandi's doctrine of non-violence."
21,1966,LAO,"The International Control Commission created by the Geneva Agreements of 1954 and 1962, to which our complaint against the North Viet-Namese intervention was directed, has recognized in its documents that the facts presented are accurate and our accusations well founded."
21,1966,LAO,"The neutrality of the Laos of 1962 would find in such an expanded neutralization a stronger and surer basis, enabling our people to be safe from foreign intervention and to move towards a harmonious development of their relations with neighbouring countries."
21,1966,COG,"The direct intervention of Washington in the domestic affairs of this country, perpetrated in defiance of the Charter of the United Nations and the Geneva Agreements on Indo-China, the dangerous ""escalation"" which has culminated just recently in the unjustifiable bombing of the suburbs of Hanoi and Haiphong, the use of poison gas against the civilian population of Viet-Nam — is there really any need to go on? — are such cruel, such savage, such barbarous acts that it is difficult to discern the slightest difference between the United States Administration and Hitler Germany."
21,1966,USA,Such intervention can find no place in the United Nations Charter nor in the resolution of the General Assembly.
21,1966,DZA,"Under the circumstances, to apply the same criterion to acts of natural solidarity between parts of one country and military intervention of the United States of America would be to present the problem in terms that would jeopardize any search for a solution."
21,1966,DZA,United States intervention in that distant country has only given the conflict a scope which transforms the just struggle for self-determination of peoples into a strategic confrontation on a world scale.
21,1966,GBR,There should be no intervention by any foreign Power in that decision.
21,1966,BRA,"In the Dominican Republic, for instance, the timely and efficient intervention of the regional Organization brought about a prompt end to civil strife and cleared the way for the restoration of democratic rule through fair and peaceful elections."
21,1966,DOM,"If this experiment designed to initiate the Dominican Republic into the practice of civilized political coexistence were to be destroyed by the violent reaction of those who do not agree with this type of community, it would not be hard to prophesy that the legal vacuum thus created would be filled by foreign intervention or by a dictatorship which would crush public freedom and delay social progress."
21,1966,GRC,"Greece, which not long ago experienced a similar type of armed subversion, directed and supported from outside, and which, with the valuable help of the United Nations and the United States, was able to safeguard its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity — Greece, which has had bitter experience of the suffering such intervention causes, cannot but feel deep sympathy for the Viet-Namese people."
21,1966,SEN,Smith that he had just informed the African leaders that there would be no military intervention in the event of a unilateral declaration of independence.
21,1966,VEN,"The difficult circumstances at present prevailing, which I have dealt with partly in this statement to the General Assembly, have given an inevitably pessimistic note to my intervention."
21,1966,KEN,Cases where there is unsolicited and unwarranted intervention in the domestic affairs of another State generate friction and ill-feeling which eventually assume the sinister form of being a threat to world peace.
21,1966,MDV,"We humbly appeal to the United Nations for timely intervention in all national disputes threatening world peace, and for peaceful settlement."
21,1966,NPL,"We have witnessed in the recent past that unsolicited armed intervention and other direct or indirect forms of interference in the affairs of other States necessarily bring in their wake complicated international problems, endangering the peace and security of many nations."
21,1966,NPL,"Had it not been for the timely intervention of the United Nations, the conflicts in Gaza, Congo, Cyprus and Kashmir probably would have escalated into major wars."
21,1966,YUG,"The failure thus far of foreign intervention to break the will of the Viet-Namese people, who are determined to be free, again confirms the fact that force cannot prevent people from attaining national independence and from choosing their social system, if they are firmly determined to do so."
21,1966,YUG,"That is why we condemn foreign intervention and the bombing of the territory of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam, a sovereign and independent country."
21,1966,TCD,"With reference to the question of the inadmissibility of intervention in the domestic affairs of States, despite the Charters of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity, despite the Declaration on this subject which the General Assembly adopted in its resolution 2131 (XX), acts of subversion of: every kind continue to rock the newer States of the world."
21,1966,DNK,Self-determination for the people of South Vietnam can be secured only by bringing all foreign intervention to an end.
21,1966,MNG,"Peace-loving peoples are shocked by the gross interference of the imperialists in the internal affairs of other States, by the armed intervention boldly perpetrated against the freedom and independence of innocent peoples."
21,1966,MNG,"With this in view, the delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic would like to emphasize that military bases in foreign territories constitute one of the major obstacles to the strengthening of the independence of the newly emerged nations, and are permanent potential means for intervention in their internal affairs."
21,1966,NER,"It is therefore becoming urgent to envisage effective compensation measures, whether in the form of currency reserves to reinforce the present action of the International Monetary Fund, or in the form of long-term credits, or in the form of an equalization fund operating at world level as an insurance fund for development; or, better still, by harmoniously combining the multiplying effects of these different modes of intervention."
21,1966,EGY,"The road to peace in Viet-Nam, therefore, requires the execution and honouring of those Agreements, whose terms will also assure for the Viet-Namese people the attainment of their national aspirations: the building of their homeland in freedom, without foreign intervention."
21,1966,TUR,"Moreover, no one can deny the right of the people of Viet-Nam to decide their own political future free from all foreign intervention."
21,1966,HUN,The intervention of the United States in South Viet-Nam goes back to 1954.
21,1966,HUN,"Since that time, step by step, the involvement of the United States has grown, both in quantity and in quality, from intervention to aggression."
21,1966,HUN,This escalation of the United States intervention is the basic factor in the origin of the present situation in South- East Asia.
21,1966,HUN,It is in the interest not only of the Viet-Namese people but also of other nations of South-East Asia and of world peace in general that the escalation of the United States intervention be stopped and the whole tide be reversed.
21,1966,HUN,"But as long as the aggression and intervention continue, it is the duty of all peace-loving nations to support the heroic struggle of the Viet-Namese people, and this assistance will certainly enable the people of Viet-Nam to endure, resist, and even overcome the attack, however much it may be escalated."
21,1966,CAF,"On the world scale, the Central African Republic reaffirms its will to choose its friends freely, with scrupulous respect for the principle of non-intervention, and it is anxious to maintain friendly relations with all peace-loving and justice-loving States."
21,1966,CHL,His proposals and his personal intervention in these problems should be fully supported by the great Powers and by all the Members of the United Nations.
21,1966,CUB,"Asia, Africa and Latin America are today the prey of a United States policy of violence, barbarism, intervention, subversion and exploitation, and the risk grows larger every day that its regional wars and depredations will be escalated into a conflict of vast dimensions."
21,1966,CUB,The Cuban delegation is categorically opposed to any kind of United Nations interference or intervention in the question of Viet-Nam.
21,1966,CUB,"In the Far East, Yankee imperialism continues to pursue a policy of violence, intervention, oppression and exploitation."
21,1966,CUB,"In our day, wars have their origin in imperialism’s policy of aggression, intervention, oppression, exploitation and cupidity."
21,1966,CUB,"The territorial and economic expansion of the United States was nurtured specifically by military aggression against the nations of Latin America, plunder of their territory, exploitation of their resources and barefaced intervention in their internal affairs."
21,1966,CUB,"The most dyed-in-the-wool lackeys and reactionary rulers of Latin America protested against the agreements reached at the Conference, alleging a violation of the principle of non-intervention."
21,1966,CUB,"But who would give credence to the charges of these so-called champions of Latin American sovereignty, for they are the same men who have been the accomplices of the acts of intervention, plunder, abuse, subversion and aggression committed by the Yankee imperialists? What moral authority can emanate from those who shamelessly accepted the military intervention in the Dominican Republic and have Joyfully acquiesced in elections held at the point of foreign bayonets? Who will regard as zealous custodians of the principle of non-intervention those who expelled Cuba from the Organization of American States and allowed their territory to be used as bases for aggression against Cuba? Who but they passively permitted the bloody aggression of the Marines against the people of Panama? Who but they have accepted without a whimper the insolent statements of the United States Executive and Legislative Branches, which threw into their faces the United States intention of disposing of the Latin American Republics as though they were part of President Johnson's ranch? In short, who but these strong-arm men and theoreticians of foreign intervention, aggression, subversion and exploitation in Latin America are the instruments and accomplices of Yankee imperialism in its flagrant and cynical violation of the principle of nonintervention?  130."
21,1966,CUB,Imperialism and intervention are one and the same.
21,1966,LKA,"To attribute motives or to suspect the professions of intention of Governments may be an easy intellectual or political exercise, but I feel a more constructive approach to the situation would be to accept the offer of the United States as a challenge and examine its possibilities, particularly since it is our view that the intervention of the United States in Viet-Nam has not been motivated by the classic colonial objectives of territorial expansion or the establishment of strategic bases."
21,1966,LKA,"My delegation nevertheless feels, as it has always felt, that this Organization, as the final repository of the hopes and aspirations, particularly of the smaller and weaker nations of the world, cannot allow itself to rest content with intervention only after a breach has actually occurred."
21,1966,GIN,"The conflict in Viet-Nam could, indeed, have remained within the limits of a civil war engaging the political factions of a country seeking its stability and its own road to development in social justice, had it not been for the direct intervention of the United States of America on the side of one of these factions."
21,1966,GIN,"We may deplore the state of affairs that led to tills direct intervention by one of the two greatest military and economic Powers of the world in the imbroglio in South Viet-Nam, an intervention that has gone beyond its original bounds to take such violent and abominable form as the bombing of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam, the fatherland of President Ho Chi Minh, that apostle of decolonization and of independence for enslaved countries."
21,1966,GIN,"It consists in a courageous and determined quest for means of ending this foreign intervention, so that the Viet-Namese people may at long last know peace and security."
21,1966,GIN,"The war in Viet-Nam, with its trail of victims-among them, the detente, decolonization and the development of the “third world”-gives us a living example of the great dangers inherent in foreign intervention in the domestic affairs of sovereign States and of the absolute necessity scrupulously to respect the provisions of the Charter in this respect and those of the Declaration, adopted at the twentieth session of the General Assembly, on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of Their Independence and Sovereignty [resolution 2131 (XX)]."
21,1966,BGR,The policy of intervention in the domestic affairs of States is creating increasing political tension in other parts of the Indo-Chinese peninsula.
21,1966,BGR,"It has been frequently emphasized from this rostrum that one of the main reasons for the tension and lack of confidence in international relations is the existence of foreign military bases on the territory of other countries, and that these bases are one of the most harmful manifestations of the policy of intervention in the domestic affairs of States."
21,1966,BGR,"Another positive fact is that despite many difficulties caused by certain imperialist circles, there is a trend in Europe not only towards economic cooperation but also towards the development of cultural, scientific, political and other relations between certain countries on the basis of equality and non-intervention in domestic affairs."
21,1966,BGR,"Among these causes, the policy of intervention and aggression is of decisive importance because its harmful consequences hinder the proper functioning of the United Nations and paralyse its activity in numerous important spheres of international life."
21,1966,GHA,"Since this is the first intervention of my delegation in the general debate, I should like to congratulate you, Mr."
21,1966,GHA,In an earlier intervention [1419th meeting] my delegation had the honour of introducing the Afro-Asian draft resolution on South West Africa [A/L.
21,1966,GHA,"therefore, not surprised that the voluntary economic sanctions invoked against Rhodesia have been a dismal failure, thanks to South African and Portuguese intervention."
21,1966,HND,"The other policy — fatal for the destiny of the American hemisphere — is that which aims at overt or covert intervention in internal affairs, through the infiltration of guerrillas, acts of terrorism, assassinations and bloodshed in general."
21,1966,HND,"These acts are contrary to the principles of the United Nations Charter and to the provisions of resolution 2131 (XX), which imposes on all Member States of this Organization the obligation to refrain from any act that might be a direct or indirect intervention in the internal affairs of any other State."
21,1966,RUS,"Nor can we forget the intervention in the Dominican Republic and the threats, intrigues and subversive activities against the peoples of a number of other countries."
21,1966,RUS,"All this gives the USSR Government reason to hope for a constructive approach at the twenty-first session of the General Assembly to the question which we are submitting as an important and urgent item, entitled ""Elimination of foreign military bases in the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America"" [A/6399], The adoption of a clear and unequivocal decision on this question would be a great step towards strengthening the independence of the newly-emerged States, protecting them from foreign intervention, and relaxing world tension,  144."
21,1966,CSK,"United States intervention in South Viet-Nam and its brutal acts of aggression against a sovereign State — the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam — are a glaring violation of the basic rules of international law, the elementary principles of humanity and the principles of the United Nations Charter, by which States should be guided in their relations with other States and peoples whether they are Members of the United Nations or not."
21,1966,CSK,"Part of the responsibility is also borne by the Governments of certain allies of the United States, which are participating in the direct intervention in South Viet-Nam."
21,1966,CSK,"The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic unreservedly supports the demands of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the National Liberation Front of South Viet-Nam, which derive logically from the terms of the 1954 Geneva Agreements and which constitute a reasonable basis for the solution of the Viet-Namese problem, The interests of peace and international security make it imperative that the United States Government should immediately and unconditionally cease bombing operations and military action against the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and armed intervention in South Viet-Nam; that the armed forces of the United States and its allies should be withdrawn from South Viet-Nam; that the United States should remove its war material and dismantle all its bases there; that it should respect the right of the South Viet-Namese people to settle their own affairs without foreign interference; that it should recognize the National Liberation Front of South Viet-Nam as the sole genuine representative of the South Viet-Namese people; and that it should consistently abide by the 1954 Geneva Agreements on  Indo-China."
21,1966,CSK,"The General Assembly should also declare categorically that any act of aggression or intervention against peoples fighting for their independence and self-determination, and the use of force against States and peoples asserting these, their inalienable rights, conflict with the honour and conscience of nations and with the United Nations Charter and are illegal."
21,1966,SLV,"In this spirit my delegations firmly supported General Assembly Resolution 2131 (XX), which condemns any act of intervention in the domestic affairs of States, not only those which involve armed intervention but also all other, forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements."
21,1966,SLV,"We reiterate our support of this condemnation, for the situations prompting it, namely, the growing threat to universal peace through armed intervention and other direct and indirect forms of intervention against the sovereign personality and political independence of States, were this very year specifically denounced to the Security Council by eighteen Latin American countries."
21,1966,SLV,"At the same time, the Council of the Organization of American States promulgated a resolution condemning specific acts in open violation of the principle of non-intervention against American States and therefore contrary to the peace and security of the continent."
21,1966,SLV,"In repeating our adherence to the Charter of the United Nations and to the Charter of the Organization of American States, especially their provisions condemning all intervention in the domestic and external affairs of States, we demand that other States abstain from organizing, supporting, fomenting, financing, instigating or tolerating armed, subversive or terrorist activities, directed towards the violent overthrow of the democratic regimes of the American States we are convinced that strict compliance with these obligations is an essential requirement if nations are to live together in peace."
21,1966,MLI,"If the policy of brute force, the policy of arbitrary and unilateral intervention in the domestic affairs of an independent country, is henceforth to take the place of the rules of international law and the principles of the Charter — as we have already seen in the Dominican Republic and in Cuba — then the law of the jungle may prevail in future in international affairs."
21,1966,MLI,"Let those who speak of possible United Nations intervention in the Viet-Namese conflict and those who preach a ""United Nations role"" simply ask themselves whether they would agree to their own vital interests being discussed and settled without them: let them ask themselves whether they would tolerate any discussion of their problems in their absence."
21,1966,MLI,"It is interesting to remember that President Kennedy, when he was only a member of Congress, uttered a serious warning against all Western intervention in Indo-China, during the Franco-Viet-Namese war."
21,1966,MAR,"We ardently hope that the parties involved will as quickly as possible find the hoped-for compromise, so that the bombing, the foreign intervention and the infiltration of troops may come to an end."
21,1966,MMR,"It is often also the case that disputes and dissensions within a country or between countries, and the resulting instability, open the door to foreign intervention."
21,1966,MMR,"Whatever the reason may be, foreign intervention, history shows, creates more conflict and causes more tensions, and does not help create conditions for peaceful adjustment or settlement of national or international disputes and situations."
21,1966,COL,"During the last session of the General Assembly, Colombia participated in the drafting and discussion of resolution 2131 (XX) on non-intervention."
21,1966,COL,"Consequently, armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements, are condemned."
21,1966,CRI,"Conflicts which in other times would have caused inexpressible suffering to humanity have been solved by the deliberations of this community of nations and its executive organs and by the action they have taken; peoples whose longing for freedom and independence was repressed have achieved recognition of their sovereignty as free States through the intervention and assistance of the United Nations; and, guided by the warmth and light of the principles and ideals which gave birth to this world Organization, the nations which have achieved the highest degree of economic and cultural development are today offering assistance from their human, technical and financial resources so that the weaker communities may find a way to strengthen their economies and improve the living conditions of their inhabitants."
21,1966,FRA,"But while we all attach importance to these two questions, while we realize that certain friendly delegations — I am thinking mainly of Canada and Ireland — are set on resolving the first of them, we are fully aware that no one wishes to augment the number of peacekeeping operations and that, in reality, no new intervention is now being contemplated and will not be, I hope, for a long time to come."
21,1966,FRA,"With the escalation continuing, how could such an overture conceivably come from anyone but the great Power directly involved, whose intervention, has been one of the basic contributing factors and which is, therefore, the only party in a position to make the move which will open up all possibilities and, first of all, that of peace? As was said in the General Assembly a few days ago, the greater the power and influence, the greater the responsibility."
21,1966,FRA,"I said from this very rostrum last year, with regard to the policy of co-operation:  ""We also believe that such a policy must be subordinated to the express condition that we refrain from linking aid, whatever form it may take, to any political condition whatever, and that we refrain from any intervention, in that connexion, in the affairs of our partners."
21,1966,UKR,"These bases and armed forces are used in interests alien to peace, as a means of exerting pressure on peace-loving States and often also as a means of direct armed intervention in their internal affairs."
21,1966,UKR,"By its very nature imperialism stands in the way of the sovereignty of States and peoples, and the policy of intervention, which is carried out in various forms, derives from the very essence of imperialism."
21,1966,UKR,"But the peoples of the whole world can and must, through their struggle, build insuperable obstacles to the struggle against imperialist intervention and must uphold the principles of the equality of rights and the sovereignty of States."
21,1966,UKR,We have already referred to the consequences of American imperialist intervention in the domestic affairs of the Viet-Namese people.
21,1966,UKR,Another example of armed intervention by the United States was provided by the well- known events in the Dominican Republic.
21,1966,UKR,Cuba is offering resolute resistance to United States intervention in its internal affairs.
21,1966,UKR,In the countries of Latin America intervention by the United States takes a wide variety of forms.
21,1966,UKR,The resolution of the United States House of Representatives of 20 September 1965 “legalizes” both indirect and direct intervention in the internal affairs of other States and peoples.
21,1966,UKR,Appeals for intervention in the internal affairs of other countries and peoples are heard from the lips of prominent statesmen and politicians of that country.
21,1966,UKR,We mention it only in order to show how thoroughly permeated United States foreign policy is with the philosophy of intervention in the domestic affairs of other States and to what extent this has become a commonplace phenomenon for a considerable number of politicians and even for the supreme legislative body of the United States of America.
21,1966,RWA,"We hope that the Council, which has the task of maintaining international peace and security, will strongly denounce and condemn the presence and intervention of mercenaries in Africa."
21,1966,KHM,"First of all, there is the direct military intervention of the Thai army against Khmer territory."
21,1966,KHM,The United Nations is an organization which was created so that the world should no longer be ruled by the use of force and so that all countries should be entitled to settle their domestic affairs without foreign intervention or interference.
21,1966,CYP,"We are, no doubt, at the end of this debate, going to reach the same lamentable conclusion: that in spite of our academic discussions and our declarations and our almost unanimous agreement on what international relations should be based upon - whether it be termed equality, whether it be termed non-interference and non-intervention, whether it be termed peaceful coexistence, whether it be termed tolerance and co-operation, political and economic-we have not succeeded, and we must not hesitate to admit it."
21,1966,GUY,"President, since this is my first intervention, permit me to offer you my congratulations on your election to the post of President of the General Assembly at its twenty-first session."
21,1966,POL,For United State intervention in Viet Nam is nothing else but a war again the national and social liberation.
21,1966,POL,"Strangely enough, political shortcomings and failures of the United Nations have been ascribed by them to the lack of an institutionalized form of intervention by the United Nations in international conflicts."
72,2017,BHR,That will terminate all forms of foreign intervention and put an end to the critical humanitarian situation of the Yemeni people.
72,2017,BHR,"We reaffirm that we do not side with any one Yemeni party against the other, but rather we oppose foreign intervention that seeks to harm this beloved country."
72,2017,BHR,That is in addition to pushing forward all efforts aimed at achieving a political solution that would preserve Syria’s unity and territorial integrity while ending foreign intervention in its internal affairs.

72,2017,SUR,"On the issues of non-interference and non-intervention, I draw the Assembly‘s attention to the following."
72,2017,SUR,Non-interference in the affairs of sovereign States and non-intervention are not empty principles.
72,2017,SUR,"So when we tell the world that non-interference and non-intervention are principles to adhere to at all costs, we are speaking from our own experience."
72,2017,SUR,"Suriname rejects any measure that might strengthen the blockade, which is in violation of international law, the sovereignty of States, the principles of non-intervention in internal affairs and self-determination."
72,2017,SUR,History proves that interference and intervention are never successful.
72,2017,SSD,The old “humanitarian intervention first and development later” paradigm is not a viable policy in the case of South Sudan.
72,2017,SSD,"As a Government, we will redouble our efforts to ensure access and improve the enabling environment for humanitarian intervention."
72,2017,EGY,"Fifthly, settling disputes in our world today can be achieved only through respect for the principles of international law and negotiation on the basis of legal, historic and moral principles, as well respect for the sovereignty of States and the principle of non-intervention in individual States’ internal affairs."
72,2017,GRC,"With regard to the Cyprus issue, our objective is summed up in the concept outlined by the Secretary-General at the international Conference on Cyprus — which is to make Cyprus a so-called normal State, one that is sovereign, independent and free of foreign-occupation troops, external guarantees and rights to intervention."
72,2017,PAK,"In recent years, some countries have displayed a growing proclivity to resort to unilateral force and intervention against other States."

72,2017,ECU,"After birth, we need to provide medical care for the child, appropriate nutrition, vaccinations, neonatal screening and early intervention."

72,2017,WSM,"Although we are a small country, Samoan police officers continue to serve side by side with officers from other countries in places that require the intervention of the United Nations."
72,2017,IRN,I want to emphasize that foreign intervention and the imposition of alien wishes on the people of the region can only widen and deepen the crises in our region.
72,2017,GMB,"We learned that willpower, national unity, decisive regional intervention and the undivided and clear support of the international community could produce positive outcomes."
72,2017,GMB,We therefore would like to seize this great opportunity to thank the leaders of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for their timely and firm intervention in bringing peace to The Gambia.
72,2017,GNQ,"All of that has been part of an attempt to confuse international public opinion about the reality of the progress achieved by Equatorial Guinea in order to justify, as always, an intention to impose so-called humanitarian intervention in our country."
72,2017,NIC,The cry in Latin America and the Caribbean is unanimous — nobody wants military intervention from the United States.
72,2017,NIC,"We emphasize the need for a political and negotiated solution between Syrians and an end to foreign intervention, including financing, military training and supplying arms to terrorist groups, so that there may finally be peace."
72,2017,URY,"Latin America has single-mindedly rejected all attempts to resolve internal conflicts in Latin America, no matter how intense they are, through military intervention."
72,2017,CYP,"In that regard, we firmly believe that the most vital element in achieving inter-State, regional and global peace is respecting and ensuring the full and unhindered independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of each and every State Member of the United Nations — a pillar that constitutes one of the most indispensable provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and the most basic rule aimed at prohibiting foreign intervention in the territory, the exclusive economic zone or the internal affairs of independent and sovereign States Members of the United Nations."
72,2017,CYP,"It is for that exact reason that, since resuming negotiations on establishing a normal and sovereign State and from the very beginning, we have made it our goal to terminate the Treaty of Guarantee and the right of intervention, as well as agree to a sunset clause for full withdrawal of the foreign occupation troops."
72,2017,CYP,"In stark contrast to the framework of the Secretary-General and the positions of the other two guarantor Powers, Turkey, in adopting an inflexible position, insisted on maintaining the Treaty of Guarantee and the right of intervention, as well as the permanent presence of troops."
72,2017,CYP,"Is it incomprehensible to aspire to establish an independent and sovereign State without foreign guarantees and the intervention of a third country, while enjoying freedom from the presence of occupation troops? Is it irrational to advocate establishing a normal State in which all decisions are made only by its citizens, free from foreign dependencies? Is it unreasonable for an EU member State to efficiently and effectively participate in the decision-making of the European Union? Is it unfounded to envision terminating the anachronistic Treaty of Guarantee and establishing a robust security system based on the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant treaties of the European Union and the Council of Europe? Is it against any established principle for the United Nations, as well as the relevant institutions of the EU, to ensure and safeguard the smooth and secure implementation of the provisions of the settlement? And is it a paradox to reject Turkey’s insistence that it should assume that role? Does any constitution of a federal State provide that, for every decision at the federal level, at least one positive vote by the members of the State is required, especially when one of the members of the federation is controlled by a third party? Finally, could anyone maintain that reaching a settlement based on Turkey’s proposals would have led to establishing a functional and viable State? Despite our disappointment, what I want to emphatically stress and convey is that the vision of the people of Cyprus is simply to end the unacceptable status quo and establish a federal State that would ensure all generations of Greek and Turkish Cypriots conditions of stability for a safe, prosperous and peaceful future; a State free from any foreign interventions and dependencies; a “normal State”, as the Secretary-General has very correctly stated; a State led by Cypriots for Cypriots."
72,2017,TUV,"Of similar concerns, the people of West Papua should be enabled to exercise their fundamental right, with the intervention of this responsible Organization, to determine their own development aspirations and future."

67,2012,KNA,"Libya and Syria, of course, are just two of the many cases that come to mind, with the myriad and multifaceted questions that they raise, not only regarding the advisability of intervention, but also with reference to such issues as the timing of any intervention, the form of any intervention and, of course, the associated humanitarian and relief-related consequences of any such intervention."

67,2012,AUS,That is a principle underpinning every Australian aid intervention and initiative: empowering women and girls.

67,2012,CHL,"The international community bears the responsibility to support that process, while respecting the principles of non-intervention, territorial integrity and, above all, human life."

67,2012,CMR,There are situations when military intervention is perhaps inevitable.
67,2012,CZE,I am sure his experience as the Serbian Minister for Foreign Affairs who saw the consequences of one kind of peacefully negotiated settlement and armed international intervention will benefit this year’s General Assembly and contribute to making our deliberations less formal and more practical.
67,2012,CZE,"Do external interventions improve the situation or do they make it worse by hindering spontaneous processes that could reintroduce stability in the region, possibly with smaller sacrifices compared to the price paid through external intervention? For instance, are the developments in Iraq, the unresolved Cyprus issue or the independence of Kosovo a success of the United Nations or not? Let me say a few words about Syria."

67,2012,BOL,"We have to be sincere and straightforward with humankind, but where there are presidents who stay in power without practicing democracy but are in favour of capitalism and imperialism, there is no intervention because they are allies of the United States Government; they are allies of the empire; they are allies of capitalism."

66,2011,TTO,"We in  Trinidad and Tobago feel that a concrete way of doing  this — an intervention strategy — is to focus, as my  country is focusing, on universal preschool education,  because we believe that the human values that are  inculcated in children from birth until ages 5 or 6 help  them to appreciate the value of peace and the value of  interpersonal peace."
66,2011,ARE,"While we are extending every required support to the  Kingdom of Bahrain, we denounce any external  intervention in Bahrain’s internal affairs."

29,1974,EGY,"We also urge, that the peoples of Cambodia and Laos be left to decide their own affairs without dictation or pressure from abroad, since the bitter experiences of the past have proved that foreign intervention leaves behind it nothing but more conflict, more devastation, more suffering."

29,1974,YUG,"The United Nations must not permit any country, on whatever grounds, to secure the right to interference and intervention, for this would be the gravest blow to efforts for the relaxation of tension in the world and the establishment of equitable international relations; it would be a dangerous threat to peace and security, and even to the very existence of the United Nations."
29,1974,YUG,"Provoked by interference on the part of imperialistic and reactionary forces in harness with the former Government of the Greek military junta, by means of the well-known putsch against the Government of the Republic of Cyprus headed by President Makarios, and in view of the unsettled relations between the two national communities in Cyprus, the crisis flared into an armed conflict and foreign military intervention, which despite the present cease-fire continues to entail great sacrifices and suffering of the population of the Republic of Cyprus."

29,1974,JAM,"We reaffirm our faith that respect for the sovereignty pf nations neither allows, first, interference by one State in the affairs of another nor, secondly, intervention in the affairs of a duly elected Government."
29,1974,JAM,"This is not the petulant retort of the poor; it is a bold statement of fact: that interdependence requires among the wealthy nations a tremendous sophistication and a denial of vanity; indeed, it requires a dilution of arrogance, where blackmail, threats and all forms of intervention in other people's affairs are out of place."

29,1974,POL,An essential precondition for a joint program for the future of Europe must always remain an awareness of the importance of the inviolability of frontiers and the territorial integrity of all States as well as respect for the principle of non-intervention in their internal affairs.
29,1974,CIV,"The crisis through which the Republic of Cyprus is at present passing derives its origin from a fear felt in common by both the Greek and Turkish communities: the fear that the island will be attached to Greece, that it will be partitioned, that there will be intervention at any moment on the part of one or another of the guarantor Powers in the internal affairs of the country."

29,1974,KWT,"In that manner they have subjected trade exchange to political and ideological considerations, and used it as an instrument of pressure and intervention in the domestic affairs of other States."
29,1974,TUR,Any action or intervention jeopardizing the independence and territorial integrity of the island consequently is inevitably a breach of this balance and a danger to peace in the region.
29,1974,TUR,"If, following the coup d'etat of 15 July last, Turkey, after having sought put all opportunities for contact and consultation and having exhausted all means of negotiation, undertook an operation on the island, it was precisely for the purpose of restoring order, putting an end to chaos and averting any intervention aimed at annexing the island."
29,1974,CYP,The Treaty did not and could not give such rights of military intervention as alleged by Turkey.
29,1974,CYP,Turkey has declared that its purpose is not partition and that its military intervention was not to that end.

29,1974,BFA,The choice that Upper Volta has made of recognizing that Government as the only legitimate one reflects our desire for peace and non-alignment and is also a clear condemnatory of foreign intervention in any country.

47,1992,SLV,"The distortions that existed  until not so long ago, due to the permanent tension reigning in an  ideologically bipolar world, have given way to a much more realistic,  humanitarian approach to the world's problems: understanding the world as an  integrated zone of peace where even the most local conflict is now a concern  of the international community, which is speedily developing the ways and   means of creating effective cooperation in peacemaking efforts, without  resorting to the barbarism of intervention or the arrogance of unilateral  operations."
47,1992,STP,"The dynamism, breadth and consensus that inspire the activities of the  Organization in the areas of conflict prevention and peace-keeping must lead  us to pay special attention to the effort to restructure the economic and  social sector in order to maximize the effectiveness of the intervention of  the various agencies of the system an effort already under way, as we have  been informed in the Secretary-General's report."
47,1992,STP,"We therefore believe that only an international effort of intelligent  convergence will permit responses that can satisfy the legitimate interests of  peoples all over the world: a task in which the United Nations should play a  key role, a role it is already demonstrating it can assume through  intervention that is increasingly prestigious because it is incisive and  pragmatic, covering the most varied regions of the world."
47,1992,LBY,"Notwithstanding those positive indications in the Organization's work, it  has been noted that some still continue to dominate the Organization and to  use it, under various pretexts, to serve their own political purposes through  the law of force rather than the force of the law, and by pursuing policies of  political and military intervention as well as economic pressure."
47,1992,LBY,"That is why my country would like to underscore the findings in  the final declaration of the Tenth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement  Countries, which called for supporting the efforts aimed at transforming the  Mediterranean into a zone of peace, security and cooperation on the basis of  the principles of respect for the equality and sovereignty of States,  non-intervention in the internal affairs of others, and the non-use or threat  of force."
47,1992,TZA,"Where the very survival of humanity is at stake, where the outbreaks  and the level of violence reach enormous proportions, threatening the very  fabric of human civilization, and where ethnic conflicts might necessitate  external intervention and thus threaten international peace and security, the  United Nations must be able to act promptly and decisively."

47,1992,CHN,"The arbitrary use of military intervention by the United Nations or  the indiscriminate and wilful imposition of mandatory measures on Member  States would not be helpful to the resolution of conflicts, and, worse still,  would impair the credibility and role of the United Nations."
47,1992,LUX,The problems raised by the presence of minority populations in the republics  of the former Yugoslavia cannot be resolved by military intervention; they can  be resolved only through negotiated arrangements modelled on those proposed in  November 1991 by the European Community.
47,1992,GHA,An international  order that can be secured only through military presence or intervention is  clearly inadequate.
47,1992,BHR,The concept of  preventive diplomacy is a new strategy based on good forecasting and early  intervention by the United Nations to prevent the eruption of conflicts and to  prevent the escalation to the level of hostilities of existing conflicts.
47,1992,GBR,"But as  the Secretary-General has pointed out, we are in danger of loading the  Organization with too heavy a burden: a burden of intervention and a burden,  in effect, of partial administration."
47,1992,HRV,"It  is for these reasons that we believe that the international community is  entitled to interfere in the internal affairs of countries in cases involving  the control of aggression, humanitarian intervention, the protection of the  rights of individuals and of national minorities and the preservation of the  environment, in accordance with the principles of, and through mechanisms  endorsed by, the international community."
47,1992,HRV,We endorse automatic international intervention and other punitive  measures when the territorial integrity of other countries is seriously  threatened.

47,1992,NLD,"Nevertheless, it would be too easy to make  non-intervention and deference to domestic jurisdiction the leading  guideline."
47,1992,NLD,"A decision not  to act in the case of flagrant violations of human rights or the rights of  minorities, or in the case of large-scale human suffering, will now set a  precedent, just as planned intervention does."
47,1992,DJI,"I share the view of the Secretary-General that the new world order must  be based on democracy in international relations, and that at the same time  each of us, particularly the developing countries, must remain steadfast on  the fundamental principles of national sovereignty, non-intervention in the  internal affairs of a State, and international cooperation."
47,1992,AUS,"And  there will be a number of such situations in which the intervention of the  international community could make a difference, so much so that there are  large moral and political pressures upon us all to take action."
47,1992,AUS,"It seems  likely, unhappily, that the United Nations will increasingly be confronted  with situations in which the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs  will be matched by a compelling sense of international conscience."
47,1992,AUS,It may be   that our Charter will never be capable of formal amendment so as to precisely  define those circumstances in which such intervention is legitimate and those  in which it is not.
47,1992,AUS,"But recent experience has shown that there is an emerging  willingness - which my country has certainly shared to accommodate  collective intervention in extreme, conscience-shocking cases, and it may well  be that a body of customary precedent will emerge over time and will  constitute its own source of authority for such intervention in the future."
47,1992,MLI,"Food shortages, endemic famine and  malnutrition, and refugees flowing into neighbouring countries are all  situations requiring more intensive humanitarian intervention by the United  Nations to support the praiseworthy efforts of the Organization of African  Unity and of many others of good will."
47,1992,SDN,"On top of all that, the States of the developing world are being  subjected now to the practices of the so-called new international legality  which means, inter alia, interference and intervention in the internal affairs  of those States and pursuance of the policies of diktat which deprive them of  the right of making their own decisions."
47,1992,SDN,"However, we notice that the principles of human rights, just like many  other ideals, are being exploited and misused as a pretext for interference  and intervention in the internal affairs of smaller States."
47,1992,SDN,"Regardless of the  claims of interference and intervention for the protection of minorities, such  behaviour is, in essence, no more than using the issue of human rights as a  weapon against those countries which do not submit to foreign diktat, and as a  means of shrugging off moral obligations towards the developing countries."
47,1992,SDN,"In our opinion, complete military intervention by the United Nations is  the only viable solution."
47,1992,LBR,"Within this context Member States that are better endowed must exercise  leadership to ensure that the United Nations becomes ready, willing and able  to engage constructively in humanitarian intervention in internal conflicts,  consistent with the guiding principles annexed to General Assembly  resolution 46/182 of 19 December 1991 and Article 2, paragraph 7, of the  United Nations Charter."

47,1992,URY,"Humanitarian aid must be  decided upon by competent international bodies, by implementation of law, and  must not serve as a cover for disguised or veiled forms of unlawful  intervention, whether on an individual or a collective basis."
47,1992,VEN,"We support the more active role he envisages for the Organization, in  the area not of intervention, but rather of prevention."
47,1992,SEN,We know too that the solution or prevention of conflicts in Africa will  be possible only if arms supplies to belligerents and other forms of outside  intervention are halted.
47,1992,SEN,"We must, however, recognize that this universal Organization is not  equally successful everywhere its intervention is desired and necessary."
47,1992,EGY,"The purposes of the Charter, however, cannot be realized, and the strong  desire to ensure justice and to promote social and economic progress cannot be  fulfilled, in an age in which acute racialist trends rear their heads anew, in  which dangers threaten the lives of whole communities, and in which there are  signs of a return to foreign intervention in the affairs of States and of  peoples."
47,1992,DNK,In my speech last autumn I pointed out how Security Council  resolution 688 (1991) might become a turning point as to the balance between  the principle of national sovereignty and that of humanitarian intervention.
47,1992,DNK,The question of humanitarian intervention has had a considerable impact on  international debate during the last year.
47,1992,DNK,"There seems to me to be growing support for the point of view that the  principle of non-intervention in the internal jurisdiction of States cannot be  taken as a shield behind which massive violations of human rights can be  allowed to take place, especially not where the human rights situations have  been characterized by the Security Council as a threat to peace."
47,1992,DNK,"A new  balance between sovereignty and international intervention is being struck, in  favour of international intervention."
47,1992,NAM,"""Directly, and through international finance and trade institutions  controlled by the wealthy States, and sometimes by embargoes or even  political intervention, the North is therefore forcing developing  countries of the South to conform to the patterns it designs."
47,1992,COG,"This historic new beginning implies a break with a development  fundamentally based on such factors external to our civil society as  international assistance, negotiated or imposed improvement in the terms of  trade, foreign investment, and the preponderant intervention of the State."
47,1992,SLE,Our intervention of  29 April was prompted by the highest of motives the salvation of our  nation.
47,1992,ISR,"The moment Lebanon  finds peace within itself and independence from outside intervention, Lebanon  and Israel will live in peace again."
47,1992,GRC,Any form of military intervention in the former Yugoslavia is highly  inadvisable.
47,1992,GRC,"Indeed, if a majority of  other States were to decide on some form of military intervention in  Yugoslavia, Greece would in no way participate."
47,1992,CUB,"The previous balance of power that contained the opposing blocs and  avoided a direct military conflict between them did not prevent the practice  of war, aggression and intervention against the third world."
47,1992,CUB,"True, universal and durable peace will be possible only in a world full  of hegemony, based on the rights, interests and aspirations of all peoples, in  a world in which the purposes and principles of the San Francisco Charter will  become a reality and, in particular, in a world which pays full respect to the  sovereign equality of States, non-intervention and non-interference in the  internal affairs of States, self-determination of peoples, and the right to  development."
47,1992,CUB,"Nor  can we we allow ideas to take hold that would introduce the concept of limited  sovereignty and promote the creation of mechanisms that would result in  converting the Organization into a permanent source of intrusion, interference  and intervention, to the benefit of the interests of the powerful."
47,1992,CUB,International bodies would be converted into mechanisms for domination  and intervention to guarantee a world system where the powerful would impose  their corrupted ideas and values.
47,1992,CPV,"In this connection, I should like to emphasize the relevance of the  proposals put forward by the Secretary-General in his report ""An Agenda for  Peace"" (A/47/277), with a view to strengthening the United Nations  intervention capacity in the prevention and management of international  crises."
19,1964,CMR,"In the other camp there is only egoism, cowardliness and treachery; and at the worst there is intervention in the affairs of others, leading to tragedy, to revolt and finally to those crises of which we have so many examples before us."
19,1964,NZL,"We urge the Indonesian Government, therefore, to reconsider its policy and turn back from the policy of armed intervention which it is now pursuing."
19,1964,TUN,"The Tunisian Government, true to its tradition of plain dealing, will join in any concerted action, at either the African or the international level, which is aimed at putting an end without delay to ail foreign intervention, in whatever form, and at devising any measure calculated to heal the situation, to restore peace and to introduce stability in that part of Africa."
19,1964,TUN,"We are convinced that the only way remaining open to us is no longer that of intervention and diplomatic ""demarches, but that already recommended by the African Heads of State and Government, as well as by the Heads of State and Government of Non-Aligned Countries, and confirmed by the experts and economists at the International Conference on Economic Sanctions against South Africa."
19,1964,BLR,"We are witnessing increasingly extensive intervention in South Viet-Nam, provocations against the Republic of Cuba, shameful interference in the domestic affairs of the Congo aimed at crushing the national patriotic forces there, and attempts to suppress the struggle of the people for freedom and independence in Angola, Aden, Oman and many other territories."
19,1964,BLR,"The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR considers that the provocations of United States warships in the Gulf of Tonkin, the attacks of military aircraft on the territory of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the intervention of armed forces in South Viet-Nam constitute acts of aggression."
19,1964,BLR,"It supports the declaration of 12 December 1964 by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and demands the immediate cessation of the intervention in Laos, the aggression in South Viet-Nam and the provocations that are creating tension throughout Indo-China."
19,1964,BLR,"Clearly in this case we are confronted with a vast conspiracy by the international forces of reaction against a democratic people's movement, with intervention in the domestic affairs of this long-suffering State, and with an attempt to force upon it a particular foreign and domestic policy."
19,1964,BLR,"There was a wave of mass protest meetings throughout the land against the intervention by the United States, United Kingdom and Belgian forces in the affairs of the young African State."
19,1964,KHM,"It is also asserted that every popular revolt which breaks out around the world, in Asia, Africa and Latin America, is the result of Chinese intervention."
19,1964,KHM,"In Laos, where United States and Thai intervention is perhaps less obvious but just as real, the situation is no better and no less explosive."
19,1964,KHM,This advocacy of political and especially military intervention in South-East Asia by our Organization is unquestionably of United States origin.
19,1964,KHM,"In support of this assertion, I should like to describe as briefly as possible one of the attempts made by the United States to bring about United Nations intervention in the Cambodian—South Viet-Namese question."
19,1964,KHM,"Today, Cambodia reiterates its opposition to any United Nations intervention in the problem of Indochina, and maintains its demand that the 1954 Geneva Conference be reconvened and that the agreements concluded at that time be reactivated."
19,1964,KHM,"Moreover, United Nations intervention in problems less complex than ours has often yielded results which have been disappointing and contrary to those hoped for."
19,1964,KHM,"Cambodia, seriously disturbed by the latest Belgian and United States military intervention at Stanleyville, desires that the imperialist stranglehold on the Congo cease and that the tragic problem of the Congo be solved through negotiation."

19,1964,PAK,"It is most regrettable that outside intervention has further compounded a difficult problem which, in the ultimate analysis, can be solved only by the Congolese themselves."
19,1964,HUN,"If the nations of Asia could take a common stand for action against foreign intervention, it would be beneficial not only to South-East Asia but to the world situation as a whole; thus, by using their political influence, they could obtain the convening of a new Geneva conference."
19,1964,CYP,"President, earlier in the general debate and in the course of a brief intervention, I had the opportunity to express to you the feelings and the heartfelt congratulations of my delegation on your well deserved unanimous election to the Presidency of the General Assembly."
19,1964,CYP,"Is Cyprus, as a sovereign State, entitled to less under the Charter than is any other Member State of the United Nations? Is Cyprus, as a sovereign State, entitled to less under the Charter and the relevant declarations of the United Nations than it would have been entitled to had it still been under the colonial administration of the United Kingdom or the domination of the Ottoman Empire? Is the United Nations prepared to agree that among its membership there are two classes of Members, with one class enjoying to the full the rights acquired under the Charter, and the other class not entitled to equality? Is the United Nations prepared to accept the untenable proposition — because that is what it amounts to — that the Charter of the United Nations may be amended by so-called treaty arrangements imposed upon colonial peoples prior to their independence? Is the United Nations prepared to ignore in the case of Cyprus the principles of sovereignty, equality, non-intervention and non-interference, unfettered independence and self-determination? Is the United Nations prepared to accept that Cyprus, an equal and sovereign Member State of the United Nations, is not entitled to enjoyment of the principles of the Charter? 96."
19,1964,CYP,"We are simply asking the General Assembly to uphold the principles of the Charter in the case of Cyprus: the principle of unrestricted sovereignty and unfettered independence, the principle that the destiny of Cyprus is in the hands of the people of Cyprus and in the hands of the people of Cyprus alone; the principle of non-aggression and non-intervention against Cyprus, the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of Cyprus, the principles of territorial integrity and unity of the country."
19,1964,IND,"India is of the view that Cyprus is entitled to, and should enjoy, its sovereignty and independence without threat or use of force by any foreign Power and without any foreign intervention or interference."
19,1964,ARG,"We have consistently adhered to the principle of non-intervention in the affairs of other States, and we have jealously guarded our own nation from outside intervention."
19,1964,ARG,"In all our international relations, we have always dealt with Governments, never with peoples — precisely in order that we should not, even inadvertently, be guilty of intervention."
19,1964,ARG,"As Argentines, proud of Calvo and Drago who formulated the principle of non-intervention at the beginning of this century, we could never depart from their hallowed doctrine."
19,1964,TTO,This is my delegation's first intervention in the general debate since Trinidad and Tobago became independent two years ago and was admitted to Membership of the United Nations.
19,1964,MLI,"In view of all the passion and controversy aroused during the various stages of the United Nations intervention in the Congo, there is justification for believing that the delegations which, for several months, have been holding the threat of Article 19 over the Assembly like a sword of Damocles, have other ends in view than the solvency of the Organization."
19,1964,SDN,"I am not inviting intervention, of course."
19,1964,CSK,The hostile acts of the United States against the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and the United States armed intervention in South Viet-Nam are extremely dangerous.
19,1964,CSK,The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic condemns those acts and supports the just struggle of the peoples of South-East Asia for free and independent development without imperialist intervention.
19,1964,CSK,A dangerous situation is also being created by overt military intervention on the part of the imperialist Powers in the domestic affairs of the Congolese people.
19,1964,CSK,"This collective intervention by the old and new NATO colonizers constitutes a further flagrant violation of the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter, and was directed not only against the Congolese people but also against Africa as a whole."
19,1964,CSK,All anti-imperialist and anti-colonial forces must unite firmly in opposition to this intervention.
19,1964,CSK,"The Government of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, in its statement of 1 December 1964, expressed full support for the efforts of the African countries, united in the Organization of African Unity, to stop this colonialist intervention in the Congo."
19,1964,ECU,"Such types of pressure fall rather within the generic concept of intervention, involving as they do the intention to impose a foreign will on a State."
19,1964,ECU,"Article 15 of the Charter of the Organization of American States, which lays down the law on non-intervention, states very explicitly that this principle ""prohibits not only armed force but also any other form of interference or attempted threat against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements""."
19,1964,ECU,"Consequently, the colonial Powers have been and are in a poor position to claim sovereign authority over those Territories, and on that basis to assert their right to freedom from intervention, denying the United Nations all competence on the grounds that those matters lie solely within their domestic jurisdiction."
19,1964,CHL,"We are helped by the conviction that the case in question, which is dividing brother nations, can only be settled equitably and definitively if the principles of self-determination, non-intervention and respect for human rights* which are the bases of inter-American coexistence and of the very Charter of the United Nations, are always borne in mind in their entirety."
19,1964,CHL,"In some cases the principle of self-determination needs to be applied more rigorously; in others, there should be more decisive intervention by the Security Council, or the conclusion of agreements between the Powers concerned, or more meaningful advances on the road to disarmament, or the elimination of mistrust and suspicion."
19,1964,CHL,Final victory over colonialism will be consolidated only when liberation leads to the economic and social well-being of peoples hitherto held back under colonial rule and when they are free from foreign interference or intervention 143.
19,1964,MYS,"There is the Viet-Nam fashion of intervention, the Laos fashion of intervention, the Cuba fashion, the South Arabian fashion, the Cyprus fashion, the Israel fashion, the Malaysian fashion, the apartheid fashion and the Congo fashion — many fashions but, in essence, with the same design and goal."
19,1964,MYS,"Here I speak only for Malaysia, and all I can say is that it supports my thesis that it has become fashionable, if I may borrow his phrase, to describe any State that one does not like, and which one cannot find an adequate reason for disliking, as ""neocolonialist"", so as to enable one to promote and pursue one's own brand of intervention."
19,1964,SYR,"This Assembly should also warn against the bad counsel of those who advocate the use of force in furthering national interests and attaining major goals of policy,, In fact, the new and sophisticated pattern of intervention which we are witnessing in the Congo today, if it continues unexposed and unchecked, could be repeated with impunity any time and anywhere in the world."
19,1964,GTM,"Chapter I contains basic provisions, such as recognition of a common nationality and personality, maintenance of the autonomy and independence of member States, respect for the principle of non-intervention, and a commitment to joint defence against any external aggression."
19,1964,ESP,"We also share the idea, which has been outlined on more than one occasion by various representatives, that at the centre, and even on the periphery, of any conflict threatening international peace and security there are countries directly and particularly concerned which have, in one way or another, special responsibility and which, in the last analysis, receive direct benefit from United Nations intervention."
19,1964,URY,"For the small States, in particular, an explicit acknowledgment by the international community that such principles as the equality of States, self-determination, territorial, integrity and non-intervention are essential elements of international public order and — as the International Law Commission stressed in the above-mentioned report — may not be the subject of negotiation, bargaining or compromise, since any treaty which violated those principles would become null and void, represents a valuable guarantee and probably, in a world in which the differences of power are so great, the only effective protection for small States against the pressures to which they have been subjected continually throughout their history."
19,1964,TCD,"The Government and people of Chad have embraced the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter and it would not be amiss, at a time when there are so many reasons for anxiety in the world, to recall some of those principles: the maintenance of a lasting peace in the world; international security; the development of friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples; pacific settlement, through negotiation, of national and international problems and disputes; promotion of respect for the human person; and, in addition, I would particularly stress, respect for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of all nations, large or small; non-intervention in the domestic affairs of States; cooperation, based on mutual interest, among all the peoples of the world, without distinction as to colour, race, or religion."
19,1964,TZA,"At the same time, the intervention of certain non-African Powers posed to Central Africa the threat of the cold war, and to Africa in general a challenge to its policy of non-alignment."
19,1964,TZA,"By calling for an end to foreign military intervention, the OAU was asking that the cold war be kept out of the Congo, and I am sure that it is in the interest of everybody here to see that the problem of the Congo is not internationalized."
19,1964,TZA,"My country was therefore shocked and horrified that at the very time that the OAU was seeking an African solution, at the very time that the Ad Hoc Commission was establishing its competence, certain non-African Powers sought fit to frustrate the efforts of the OAU by unwarranted military intervention."
19,1964,TZA,"This military intervention, in furtherance of a military pacification, is a clear affront to the OAU, and shamefully detracts from the United Nations efforts in the Congo during the last four years."
19,1964,TZA,"My delegation deems this military intervention all the more reprehensible for the excuse that it was undertaken, not to bring peace to the Congo, but to save a few lives so that tenfold more should die."
19,1964,TZA,My delegation considers that this intervention bears within it the seeds of world conflagration.
19,1964,COG,"The Congolese delegation opposes the tendency of some great Powers, whichever they may be, to use their influence to create areas of tension in the world, secure the intervention of United Nations forces in those areas, install themselves there as neocolonialists and apply policies there which conform to their own selfish interests."
19,1964,MDG,"Is it natural to respond to humanitarian considerations by taking refuge in legal argumentation and to carry cynicism to the point of executing patriots, as was done a few weeks ago, despite the intervention of such a universally recognized moral authority as that of Pope Paul VI? 146."
19,1964,MDG,"These facts show that although the principle of non-intervention in matters within the domestic jurisdiction of a State is one to which we attach great importance, there are countries which dare to abuse it in an attempt — an unsuccessful attempt — to vindicate themselves to world public opinion which has already taken it upon itself to condemn the inhumanity and injustice of a system based on discrimination."
19,1964,MEX,"""Non-intervention and the right of self-determination are principles which, for more than a century, we have constantly upheld."
19,1964,MEX,"""We were born under the sign of anti-colonialism and in the past we have suffered invasion, attack and intervention."
19,1964,MEX,"At the invitation of the Mexican Government, the Special Committee established by the General Assembly under its resolution 1966 (XVIII) of 16 December 1963 met from 27 August to 2 October last at Mexico City in order to study four basic principles of international law concerning friendly relations and cooperation among States: namely, prohibition of the use or threat of force, the peaceful settlement of disputes, non-intervention and the sovereign equality of States."
19,1964,MEX,One of them — non-intervention by one State in the affairs of another — is not even explicitly stated in the Charter.
19,1964,MEX,"Again, the more or less numerous exceptions recognized under the classic concept of non-intervention in the nineteenth and early in the twentieth century are today totally incompatible with the principle of the sovereign equality of all States, on which, as the Charter explicitly stipulates, our Organization is based."
19,1964,MEX,My delegation is convinced that some of the proposals submitted to the Special Committee on the principle of non-intervention will be of incalculable value in the General Assembly's discussions on this very important matter.
19,1964,HND,"Accordingly, the Government of Honduras once again declares its respect for the principle of nonintervention in the domestic affairs of other countries, but at the same time reiterates its firm determination to oppose, by all necessary means, any foreign intervention in its territory."
19,1964,HND,Armed intervention in order to impose a totalitarian and dehumanized doctrine on a people can only be the last desperate resort when the power of conviction has failed.
19,1964,NER,"Unswervingly committed to the principle of non-interference, we roundly and unequivocally condemn all forms of intervention, regardless of their origin."
19,1964,UKR,"United States intervention also extends to the countries adjoining South Viet-Nam, such as Cambodia, whose territory has been subjected to air raids."
19,1964,UKR,"For those responsible for such military intervention, however, this is just another page in the book of colonialist punitive expeditions."
19,1964,UKR,The military intervention in the Congo leaves no room for doubt that the colonial Powers are acting in accordance with a previously prepared plan.
19,1964,ROU,"How, then, can the foreign armed intervention against the Congolese people be described, but as a ’grave violation of the Charter? This totally unjustified action, which prolongs the sufferings of the Congolese people, is one of a long series of open or covert actions, typical of colonialism, aimed at curbing the will of this sorely-tried people to decide its own future."
19,1964,ROU,"Foreign intervention in South-East Asia, where a state of tension continues to prevail, is an undeniable violation of the provisions of the Charter."
19,1964,ROU,"We are firmly convinced that no obstacle, no foreign intervention, can prevent the fulfilment of these aspirations, and that the historic process at present under way is about to wipe out the last vestiges of the colonialist system."
19,1964,ALB,"These allegations come from one source only — Washington — and have only one purpose — to justify the intervention in South Viet-Nam and Laos, and to prepare world opinion for aggression against North Viet-Nam."
19,1964,ALB,We call for the immediate cessation of all forms of United States intervention in this area.
19,1964,ALB,"In expressing the deep sympathy of the Albanian people for the Congolese people’s struggle for liberation, the Albanian delegation associates itself with the delegations of the countries which are asking that foreign intervention in the Congo should cease forthwith and that the Congolese people should be left to solve their own problems in freedom."
19,1964,SWE,"Firstly, there is the question of intervention and outside interference."
19,1964,TUR,"Turkey was one of the first countries to proclaim the principle of self-determination of peoples and to oppose all foreign intervention, whether political or economic, in its national affairs."
19,1964,DZA,"However, the economic imbalance between States creates conditions favourable to the development of neo-colonialism and a policy of intervention in the internal affairs of other States."
19,1964,DZA,"In South-East Asia, too, the situation is continuing to deteriorate as a result of foreign intervention."
19,1964,DZA,However there can be no doubt that imperialist intervention has aggravated the situation.
19,1964,VEN,"Even in those cases where there has been brazen intervention in our internal affairs, with the avowed aim of destroying what has been created by the self-determination of our people, my Government has had recourse to the appropriate international organization and through the justice of our cause, has obtained the condemnation of the aggressors."
19,1964,VEN,"It is a serious matter and represents a threat to the maintenance of peace; we think that in order to counteract its effects a special agreement might be concluded, containing rules and procedures and establishing exemplary sanctions to be applied against Governments which appear to be guilty of such acts of intervention and indirect aggression."
19,1964,BGR,The armed intervention by Belgium and the United States in the internal affairs of this unhappy country shows clearly the determination of colonialism and imperialism to retain their hold on this country's resources at all costs.
19,1964,BGR,"Foreign intervention is once more rife in the Congo, where the white mercenaries continue to commit appalling crimes."
19,1964,BGR,Armed intervention in the Congo must be brought to an end at once.
19,1964,GHA,"Furthermore, it must be accepted that no solution is possible as long as there is foreign military intervention."
19,1964,RUS,"The Cairo Conference of Non- Aligned Countries quite rightly included the following in its decisions: ""Economic pressure and domination, interference, racial discrimination, subversion, intervention and the threat of force are neo-colonialist devices against which the newly-independent nations have to defend themselves."
19,1964,RUS,"The Soviet Union deems it necessary to emphasize that the armed intervention of the United States of America in the affairs of South Viet-Nam with a view to suppressing the national liberation struggle of the people of South Viet-Nam, and the plans — of which rumours have been heard—to expand the military conflict in South Viet-Nam, are fraught with grave threats to the preservation of peace throughout South-East Asia — and not only there."
19,1964,RUS,"The Soviet Government expresses its full sympathy with the efforts of the African States to put an end to military and any other intervention by the colonizers in the affairs of the Congo and to bring about the immediate withdrawal from the Congo of all foreign military personnel, including mercenaries, who even now are massacring Congolese patriots."
19,1964,RUS,"We must make further progress, in order to save the world from the dangers created by the arms race, by foreign intervention in the internal affairs of a number of countries and peoples, and by the remaining tension in the relations between dozens of States."
19,1964,EGY,The civil strife and the instability which prevail today in the Congo result directly from a systematic policy of foreign intervention by Powers from outside Africa.
19,1964,EGY,This policy of intervention has continued ever since the Congo attained its independence.
19,1964,EGY,"The thousands of Congolese people would not have died had there been respect by all for the political independence and territorial Integrity of the Congo, as well as the numerous resolutions of the United Nations specifically prohibiting foreign intervention."
19,1964,EGY,"It was not until there was foreign intervention, culminating in a most regrettable form — that is, the use force against the territorial integrity of the Congo — that the lives of thousands of Congolese and non-Congolese came into immediate danger."
19,1964,EGY,Foreign intervention on the part of Belgium and the United States jeopardized the efforts of the Ad Hoc Commission to bring about an acceptable solution to the Congolese question.
19,1964,EGY,"As a result of foreign intervention, the problem of the Congo thus emerged with even more complications, leading to the deteriorating situation we are facing in the Congo today."
19,1964,EGY,"The delegation of the United Arab Republic feels it imperative to emphasize that a policy of systematic foreign intervention, whose instruments are all alien and hostile to the dignity of Africa and the African people, is a policy which is doomed to failure."
19,1964,MNG,"The far from stable situation in the Congo has recently deteriorated sharply as a result of the armed intervention by Belgium and the United States in that country, with the assistance of the United Kingdom Government."
19,1964,MNG,That armed intervention was undertaken on the pretext of rescuing the white population — the so-called hostages.
19,1964,MNG,The true nature and purpose of that open intervention are clear to anyone who is objective.
19,1964,MNG,"Foreign intervention in the internal affairs of the Congo must be stopped forthwith and all foreign troops, including mercenaries, must be withdrawn from that country in order to avoid a repetition of the bitter lesson of the past and to prevent the crisis from worsening."
19,1964,MNG,The Mongolian delegation strongly condemns the policy of gross intervention and blackmail which the Governments of the United States and of some of that country’s partners among the members of the Organization of American States are pursuing with regard to the Republic of Cuba.
19,1964,MNG,This alone will enable the Korean people to decide their own fate without foreign intervention.
19,1964,MNG,They are constantly being used by the old and new colonial Powers for intervention in the domestic affairs of other States with a view to suppressing the national liberation movements.
19,1964,MNG,"As correctly noted in the Declaration of the Cairo Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries, racial discrimination, economic pressure, subversion, intervention and the threat of force are favourite neo-colonialist devices."
19,1964,GRC,"It is now my pleasant duty to pay a tribute to the outstanding personality of our Secretary-General who, in organizing the Force sent to Cyprus, guiding it at every step, appointing the two successive mediators and his personal representatives in Cyprus and being the inspiration and the driving force of the whole United Nations intervention in the Cyprus affair, has acquired a new title to the esteem and gratitude of all Member States."
19,1964,BOL,Instances of violence in many countries progressing towards sovereignty are still fresh in our minds and it is obvious that United Nations intervention has had no effect.
19,1964,SEN,"The recent American-Belgian intervention in the Congo aroused much excitement in Africa, and often, we must say, false indignation."
19,1964,SEN,"Only recently, African Governments appealed for the intervention of European Powers to put down uprisings, and nothing was said."
19,1964,CAF,"For such friendships to blossom and grow, they must of course be accompanied by a scrupulous respect for the principle of non-intervention in domestic affairs, and by careful precautions which must be observed by even the most well-intentioned and most earnest advisers, so that it is never forgotten that the decision is ours and ours alone."
19,1964,CAF,"There was an attempt to convince us that the foreign intervention at Stanleyville last November had a humanitarian purpose; nevertheless, we cannot but say that its murderous character shocked us."
19,1964,CUB,"The United States, for its part, is certainly intervening; it has a long history of intervention in America."
19,1964,CUB,"Underhand intervention is being carried out through military missions which take part in internal repression — by organizing armed forces for that purpose in a number of countries — and in all the coups d’état known as ""gorilazos"", which have occurred so frequently on the American continent in recent times."
19,1964,KEN,"This Congo tragedy is the result of naked, unwarranted foreign intervention, which continues unabated up to this day."
19,1964,KEN,"After protracted negotiations and thorough deliberations, the commission decided that all white mercenaries and foreign troops should be withdrawn forthwith from the Congo, and that all foreign intervention should cease immediately."
19,1964,KEN,"But his task was made impossible by the intensified military intervention of the United States and Belgium, with the actual connivance of the United Kingdom Government, which provided facilities for mounting the military intervention."
19,1964,KEN,"This intervention, solicited under heavy pressure, in circumstances amounting to breach of faith and in callous disregard of the efforts of the Organization of African Unity ad hoc commission, unfolded yet another chapter in the tragedy of the Congo, resulting in the loss of thousands of innocent lives, including those of some of the hostages."
19,1964,KEN,The hostages would probably be alive today had it not been for the United States-Belgium military intervention.
19,1964,KEN,"It almost seemed that the United States was not as much concerned with the lives of the hostages as with the fall of Stanleyville, which became a top military priority in its intervention."
19,1964,KEN,The gruesome results of this so-called humanitarian intervention are too well known to be recounted here.
19,1964,KEN,"Let it be understood, here and now, that an imagined or real danger to certain minority groups in a particular country in Africa does not confer on any foreign Power the right of military intervention in that country."
19,1964,KEN,"to all foreign Powers at present interfering in the internal affairs of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, particularly those engaged in military intervention in that country, to cease such interference, which infringes the interests and sovereignty of the Congolese people and constitutes a threat to neighbouring countries."
19,1964,KEN,"I would like to put it on record that Africa will no longer tolerate, or permit the existence of, colonialism and neo-colonialism, no matter in what form it is disguised or from what source it emanates: whether it assumes the form of political subversion, military intervention, the threat of force, the corruption of leaders, the creation by outside Powers of puppets to disrupt established authority, or economic pressures."
19,1964,KEN,We support the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and its protection from outside intervention in its internal affairs.
19,1964,KEN,"The internal problem of Cyprus can be solved only by the people themselves, without outside intervention, on the universally accepted democratic principle of majority rule, on the basis of which all democratic countries are administered."
19,1964,BDI,"Since 1960, appeals have been made to the highest bodies of the United Nations, particularly the Security Council, which at that time was seized of the problem of the Belgian military intervention in the Congo."
19,1964,BDI,"Henceforward, any intervention in the affairs of Africa by a non-African Power may be harmful to Africa, for such an intervention can only complicate the international situation and involve a threat to world peace."
19,1964,BDI,"The sudden intervention at Stanleyville of paratroops transported in aircraft provided by the United States State Department from Ascension Island, which is under British control, undid the work which had been begun by the ad hoc Commission and ruined the prospects for Congolese national reconciliation, which was at that time in sight."
19,1964,BDI,"When non-African intervention in the affairs of the Congo has ceased and the mercenaries have left the country, the settlement of the Congolese problem will present no further difficulty."
19,1964,BDI,All that the African countries ask of the United Nations and the Security Council is to take steps to prevent intervention by non-African Powers in the affairs of Africa and to ensure that foreign troops and mercenaries leave the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
19,1964,IDN,"In this context, it can be used as a means fox pursuing the policy of ""divide and rule"", utilizing this pacific penetration as a basis for intervention and subversion, in addition to the legitimate but unfair competition between the strong and the weak."
19,1964,IDN,"Economic pressure and domination, interference, racial discrimination, subversion, intervention and the threat of force are neo-colonialist devices against which the newly independent nations have to defend themselves"" [A/5763, sect."
19,1964,IDN,"One need only read the few books published on the subject of how intervention and subversion are skilfully planned and carried out, to understand the problems faced by the newly developing countries."
19,1964,IDN,"If there is no intervention, especially from abroad, no intervention from large, powerful nations, every conflict or contradiction within the new State or between neighbouring States can be easily solved."
19,1964,IDN,"Its aim is to promote our self-confidence, to enable us to run our own national affairs and to free our countries from foreign intervention to the extent that in quarrels or disputes between ourselves in our own region, we ourselves should find the solution by mutual discussion and understanding, without interference from outside Powers."
19,1964,IDN,"There is the Viet-Nam fashion of intervention, the Laos fashion of intervention, the Cuba fashion, the South Arabian fashion, the Cyprus fashion, the Israel fashion, the Malaysian fashion, the apartheid fashion, and the Congo fashion — many fashions but, in essence, with the same design and goal."
19,1964,IDN,"In this context, however, while not by any means condoning the intervention of neo-colonial Powers, I submit that the facts have proved that their imperialist policies — the encircling, threats, blockades of the newly developing countries — have in reality brought about results quite contrary to what was originally intended."
19,1964,POL,"As regards South Viet-Nam: long years of armed intervention in a futile undertaking aimed at breaking the people's will, and now, in order to break the deadlock, acts of aggression against the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and threats to spread the war to the territory of that country; those who make these threats must realize the resolute opposition which they will encounter and what the consequences may be."
19,1964,SOM,"Over the years, and increasingly of late, there have been examples of military intervention, upon one pretext or another, against the territory of other States."
19,1964,SOM,"Contrary to accepted international practice, and in defiance of the principles of the United Nations Charter and the appeals of African States, we have had the distressing experience of witnessing a flagrant and armed intervention in the domestic affairs of the Congolese people."
19,1964,SOM,"Indeed, if outside Powers were to cease their intervention in the affairs of the peoples of these areas, my Government is, confident that these situations would become stabilized and the peoples would work out their or/n solution, as they have the right to do."
19,1964,NGA,There is too much intervention in the affairs of the Congo.
19,1964,NOR,"In the world of today armed conflict anywhere may spread and lead to great-Power intervention and, indeed, ultimately to atomic extinction of us all."
19,1964,LAO,"The Geneva Agreements of 1954 provided for an International Commission, not only to supervise and control the observance of the cease-fire, but also to investigate violations of article 2 of the Protocol, in particular those concerned with foreign military intervention."
19,1964,LAO,The Pathet Lao had rejected the charge of North Viet-Namese intervention claiming that they themselves were not even involved and that the fighting was only between different Neutralist factions.
19,1964,ITA,"But in the meantime the process of strengthening the authority of the United Nations and its capacity for intervention and mediation must, from now on, be synchronized and gradually intensified as we move towards disarmament."
48,1993,BTN,"As the need for peace-keeping in other parts of the world grows, it is clear that in future the terms of every intervention must be carefully defined."
48,1993,DJI,"The principle of humanitarian intervention would conflict with the notion of State sovereignty, but at the present juncture the United Nations is still the only available ""fire department,"" if I may use that term."
48,1993,COD,"The plethora of hotbeds of tension and the recourse to military action, whether for intervention or for pacification, are likely to wipe out these efforts and to damage the humanitarian action and the noble objectives of peace and harmony pursued by the United Nations."
48,1993,BRB,"You are well aware, Sir, that the Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community were long convinced that the unfortunate and unacceptable state of affairs resulting from the overthrow of the elected President of Haiti could be resolved only through the intervention of the Security Council, the valiant efforts of the Organization of American States notwithstanding."
48,1993,UKR,"At the same time, it is important to preserve the Council’s ability to respond effectively to emergencies that require prompt intervention."
48,1993,MLI,"In any event, my country feels that the imperative of restructuring is to maintain and indeed strengthen the United Nations capacity for intervention in development matters."
48,1993,MLI,"It is at this level that many expect intervention from our Organization, and we can indeed help."
48,1993,IND,"The imposition of peace through unilateral external intervention will only perpetuate situations embodying the Orwellian logic of ""peace is war"" that we see in many parts of the world today."
48,1993,IND,"We would, however, like to point out that any unilateral use of human rights as an instrument of political pressure or intervention, or as an obstacle to trade or a condition for development cooperation and aid, in fact serves the opposite purpose and impedes the full realization of the human rights of people of affected countries."
48,1993,BWA,We have always maintained that no nation has the right to violate the basic human rights of its citizens while using Article 2 (7) of the Charter as an argument against intervention by the international community.
48,1993,PRY,"With timely intervention, the United Nations has brought lengthy conflicts to an end and achieved their settlement."
48,1993,VCT,"Stressing our commitment to the goal of the complete eradication of colonialism, we once again pledge to strengthen our solidarity with all those countries facing aggression or intervention or interference in their internal affairs."
48,1993,CUB,"The selfishness and lack of political will faced by the poor of this Earth, the children of colonialism, racism, plundering and foreign intervention, are truly disappointing."
48,1993,CHN,"Increasing foreign intervention has heightened various internal factors of instability, thus compounding their difficulties."
48,1993,BEN,"Each day, in one place or another on our planet, civil wars, territorial partition, ethnic confrontations and tribal or religious struggles demand the urgent intervention of the United Nations."
48,1993,ARM,"Now more than ever, it is incumbent upon the United Nations to revisit its provision of non-intervention in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of Member States, and to define more stringently the extent of the impact of a conflict on the peace and security of other nations."
48,1993,FSM,"The independent, juridical composition of any such body should place it above concerns regarding political intervention while denying human rights violators any refuge from defined international responsibility."
48,1993,HND,"In Somalia, there is no national government to ensure that the United Nations intervention in that country will not only mitigate the hunger which unfortunately afflicts its inhabitants but also make it possible, with the full participation of the Somalis, to follow the path to peace, coexistence and the restoration of normalcy."
48,1993,URY,"In this context, which is fraught with uncertainty and unpredictable events, the principles of self-determination, non-intervention, the peaceful settlement of disputes and the observance of good faith in the fulfilment of international obligations must be interpreted not as concepts that are vague or not properly drawn up by a naive legal system, but as the pillars of international relations."
48,1993,MAR,20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session The often-sought intervention by the United Nations in areas as diverse as the peaceful settlement of conflicts and the organization and supervision of elections has resulted in an increase in its volume of work and has justified the call for the strengthening of the Organization and support for its work.
48,1993,MAR,"Those transformations have given rise to new concepts, notions and priorities, such as preventive diplomacy, post-conflict peace-building, and brought to the fore such issues as those of human rights and of intervention on humanitarian grounds in the course of the ongoing global debate on what is termed ""the new world order"" that is in the making."
48,1993,AUS,"Should we recognize, for example, a humanitarian right of intervention and, if so, in what circumstances and to what extent? When does an economic or social problem become the kind of security problem which justifies the mobilization of the response strategies spelt out in Chapters VI and VII of the United Nations Charter? Even when it comes to applying a very familiar response to a new problem - for example, establishing a peace-keeping operation like the 30 which have now been initiated since 1946 - there does not yet seem to have been developed a commonly accepted check list of criteria to guide decision-makers in determining when precisely the operation should be set in train, how it should be structured, managed and resourced, or how long it should continue."
48,1993,LBR,"In recent years, the United Nations has taken bold decisions in peacemaking, peace-keeping and peace-building, humanitarian intervention and the protection of human rights."
48,1993,CHL,"While respecting our respective traditions and abiding by the inviolable principles of international law, including non-intervention and the sanctity of treaties as the source of rights, we have nevertheless understood that, as the twenty-first century approaches, it will be useful to exchange ideas about our national aspirations, inasmuch as they promote the maintenance of peace."
48,1993,MMR,"Just as the prohibition of the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State is fundamental in inter-State relations, the Charter unambiguously prohibits, in the well-known paragraph 7 of Article 2, any intervention of the United Nations itself ""in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State""."
48,1993,OMN,"We are convinced that no matter how far apart the positions of the parties to any conflict are, they will not reject intervention by the United Nations if the intervention is timely and appropriate."
48,1993,GNQ,"Measures such as the sending of missions of inquiry, the use of early-warning systems and the strengthening of the role of regional and subregional organizations can be effective in avoiding conflicts which, once they break out, could require subsequent, much more costly intervention for peace to be restored."
48,1993,JOR,"We seek to extend the principles of consensus and collective security to the Middle East to create a new regional order, an order which recognizes the right of each individual to lead a life free from fear, want and despair, an order which will provide justice to all peoples and security to all States, an order in which the United Nations and its agencies can play a positive role not only in humanitarian intervention or the protection of human rights, but in active peace-keeping and peacemaking."
48,1993,JOR,"We must all assist the Secretary- General in determining the criteria for United Nations intervention, whether in Lebanon, Iraq, Somalia, Bosnia, Angola, Cambodia or anywhere else."
48,1993,BDI,"4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session In the meantime, we are using the modest means at our disposal, while relying on national solidarity and, especially, on the laudable intervention of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to whom we again express our deep gratitude."
48,1993,BRA,"Some of these concepts were presented under the cloak of humanitarian or moral values, such as the so-called ""right of intervention"" and ""good governance""; others are renewed versions of old practices, such as eco-protectionism."
48,1993,GMB,"Let us not forget now, in the heat of the moment, the very positive achievements of the intervention, which has made it possible to distribute food among a population that was suffering from one of the most horrendous forms of famine."
48,1993,TZA,But the Council’s capacity to respond to the growing demands for its intervention and the readiness of the international community to continue to repose its trust and confidence in the Council will depend on its ability to institute the necessary reforms.
48,1993,BIH,"The United Nations intervention, in its half-heartedness and equivocation, combined with its proud insistence that it is getting the job done and that therefore we cannot be allowed to arm ourselves, may well go down in history as the principal instrument of my country’s destruction."
48,1993,BIH,"Why has there been no implementation of Security Council resolutions 824 (1993) and 836 (1993) calling for the lifting of the siege of our cities? What has happened to the Security Council’s demands in resolution 752 (1992) for the withdrawal of all Serbian military and paramilitary units from our country along with their heavy weapons? Why has there been no implementation of Security Council resolutions 787 (1992) and 838 (1993), which were to monitor the border between Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina and prevent the continuing massive flow of arms and material going to the aggressors in Bosnia? It is no longer possible to speak of non-intervention."
48,1993,BIH,The United Nations must either follow 4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session through with its intervention or decide to rescind that intervention.
48,1993,LUX,"In Somalia, however, intervention by the United Nations has demonstrated the limits of armed intervention in a tribal civil war in the absence of a political agreement and a cease-fire."
48,1993,LUX,Once a conflict has been unleashed it requires a much more costly intervention to ensure the restoration of peace.
48,1993,IRQ,"Iraq continues to be denied the right to use its civil aircraft and ships and continues to be subjected to flagrant military intervention in its internal affairs, to daily acts of violation of its airspace, and to the perpetration of a declared conspiracy against its political system."
48,1993,UGA,"When a group’s major consideration is military victory, contrary to the agreements reached, this may call for legitimate international intervention."
48,1993,ECU,Ecuador has decided to carry out serious and thorough structural reforms that will permit greater scope for private enterprise and individual initiative and that will reduce Government intervention wherever it has proved to be ineffective and inappropriate.
48,1993,THA,"With cold-war constraints on United Nations regional intervention removed, the Organization is in an ideal position to cooperate with ASEAN to ensure peace and stability in South-East Asia."
48,1993,GUY,"While recognizing the need to provide the Council with enforcement capacity under Chapter VII of the Charter, we place special importance on preventive diplomacy, which would obviate recourse to physical intervention."
48,1993,NPL,The grounds for the intervention of the Security Council have also raised questions of consistency.
48,1993,TJK,Everyone knows that until recently Tajikistan had been systematically subjected to unprovoked acts of armed intervention from the territory of a neighbouring country.
48,1993,ERI,"As the bloodletting among our Somali brothers assumed harrowing proportions, and at a time when many were hesitating, we strongly advocated the constructive intervention of the international community, under the umbrella of the United Nations, to save lives and help extricate Somalia from the destruction it was heading for."
48,1993,ERI,"Despite our opposition in principle to external military intervention, we realized early on that the extraordinary situation in Somalia demanded extraordinary measures."
48,1993,ERI,"Encouraged, we sought - individually and in conjunction with our regional partners - to ensure that the intervention would be guided by clear and comprehensive security, and humanitarian and political objectives."
48,1993,ERI,"And we did not hesitate to share our views on the size, type and length of stay of the intervention force needed for the success of the mission."
48,1993,ERI,"Be that as it may, we recognize and appreciate the achievements of the international intervention in Somalia."
48,1993,ERI,"At the same time, the worsening security situation in Mogadishu and the increasing toll in human lives, including women and children, have cast a long shadow on the intervention in Somalia."
48,1993,ERI,Repeated mistakes in handling the situation have led some people openly to call for an immediate end to the intervention.
48,1993,ERI,"It is our conviction that a precipitate withdrawal of United States troops - which we strongly warned against from the beginning - would not only signal a lack of United States commitment to the intervention, but would eventually make the position of the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II) untenable."
48,1993,ERI,This would plunge Somalia into a catastrophe much worse than the anarchy that prompted the intervention in the first place.
48,1993,ERI,"We also urge them to review, frankly and dispassionately, the intervention to date, build on the successes and achievements and, more importantly, admit and correct mistakes."
48,1993,LKA,"With regard to national disputes, United Nations intervention must be considered only upon the request of the Member State concerned."
48,1993,BLZ,"Furthermore, in the original Somalia intervention, we see strong confirmation of the continuing vitality of the principle of ""freedom from want"" - for all of us will remember that the avowed objective of the current exercises in that beleaguered country was to bring food, comfort and succour to its suffering people."
48,1993,WSM,"Its attainment was made possible by the constructive intervention of the United Nations decolonization Committee and by the willingness of the Government of France, the parties in New Caledonia and the South Pacific Forum to show restraint to give full consideration to each other’s concerns and sensitivities."
48,1993,KHM,We hope that the intervention of the international community will put a swift end to these conflicts that have caused so much bloodshed.
48,1993,BEL,"In addition to the immediate cash-flow problems, there is an increasing structural deficit in the balance between the ability to take multilateral action and ever-increasing requests for intervention."
48,1993,BEL,"But are they ready? Do they exist everywhere? Does the strengthening of cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations offer real prospects if the latter do not become effective centres of decision and action? We feel that, without the capacity for swift and ongoing intervention on a regional scale, preventive diplomacy by our Organization is a resource which is undoubtedly indispensable but of limited scope."
48,1993,CAN,"To do that, the Secretary-General should be given the resources necessary for independent political analysis, analysis that he could draw on before armed conflict is unleashed and when non-military intervention can still be effective."
48,1993,SMR,Now the Organization must intensify its intervention straightforwardly and incisively in order to resolve critical situations.
38,1983,ALB,Chad is the most recent example of imperialist intervention.
38,1983,ALB,"The African peoples have never accepted this situation; they have fought, and continue to fight, against imperialist intervention, racism and racial discrimination."
38,1983,ALB,"A very grave situation has been created in Central America, where the United States has stepped up its pressure and its military intervention against the freedom- loving people of Nicaragua, and where it is financing and sending mercenary troops to suppress the struggle of the people of that region."
38,1983,GNB,"The tragic situation prevailing in Chad and the sad fate of the people of that African country, which has been the victim for more than two decades of internecine struggle aggravated by incessant foreign interference and intervention, are a source of profound concern to us."
38,1983,GNB,"The serious political, economic and social crisis in the countries of those regions, due in part to the existence of traditional structures, repressive regimes and inadequate economic structures that lead to poverty and favour social inequality, is incessantly aggravated by interference and intervention from outside."
38,1983,BHR,"We appeal once again to the two warring parties to settle their differences by peaceful means and restore normal relations between them, on the basis of mutual respect, good neighbourliness and non-intervention in their domestic affairs."
38,1983,AUT,The armed intervention in Afghanistan continues to cause immense human suffering and is a serious threat to the stability of the entire region.
38,1983,LUX,The intervention of the Libyan army in the territory of Chad constitutes inadmissible interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign country and therefore a clear violation of the Charter of the United Nations.
38,1983,LUX,Foreign armed intervention only aggravates the conflict in that country and prevents the consolidation of the internal situation.
38,1983,LUX,But local problems are now aggravated by external intervention.
38,1983,ARE,"The continuation of the war between Iraq and Iran, with its massive losses, threatens the peace and security of the States of the region and could serve as a pretext for intervention in the region by the great Powers."
38,1983,ARE,We believe in the right of every people to choose the system of government it desires and in the non-intervention by any State in the internal affairs of another.
38,1983,ARE,"On the basis of this belief, we call for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Afghanistan and for non-intervention in its internal affairs, thus allowing its people alone to choose its system of government."
38,1983,ARE,We also urge the settlement of the conflict existing between North Korea and South Korea through free dialogue in order to remove the causes of that conflict and to realize the desire of their peoples for national unity without any foreign intervention.
38,1983,ARE,"These were reflected in numerous violations of the Charter of the United Nations, in invasion and military occupation, in intervention in internal affairs and in violations of human rights."
38,1983,SLV,"The presence of this ideological bipolarity can be seen in the deterioration and breaking down of the normal harmonious relations among the countries of the area, violating in practice and repeatedly the sacred principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of the various brother countries."
38,1983,SLV,"In connection with the military intervention by Viet Nam in Kampuchea, my Government considers that the withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops is an urgent prerequisite for the achievement of peace in South-East Asia."
38,1983,SLV,Therefore El Salvador cannot fail to express its support for respect for the right of self-determination for the people of Chad and the principle of non-intervention in their internal affairs.
38,1983,SLV,"Antagonisms in Central America are increasing as a result of the clear practice by some regimes of intervention in the external and internal affairs of other countries, as well as the stepping up of an irrational arms race and the promotion and toleration of the illegal arms traffic."
38,1983,SLV,"If we wish to achieve peace in Central America and spare our compatriots suffering and bloodshed, we cannot continue to endure the scourge of intervention- ism nor should we tolerate the intermediaries or their destabilizing acts."
38,1983,SLV,"Peace is the solution to the Central American crisis, and in order to achieve it we must work on four basic points: first, the promotion of integral and balanced development in the region directed towards restructuring and social change; secondly, the establishment, promotion and development of democratic, pluralist and participatory institutions; thirdly, the safeguarding of respect for human rights in their various manifestations; and fourthly, the re-establishment of security in Central America, rejecting aggression and foreign intervention."
38,1983,SLV,"In this context my Government is clearly aware of the need for regional dialogue to promote agreement leading to peace, without foreign intervention or pressure."
38,1983,SLV,"The first is related to the implementation of the traditional principles of international law, such as respect for the self-determination of peoples, legal equality of States, non-intervention in internal affairs, peaceful settlement of disputes and co-operation for development."
38,1983,MOZ,"I am addressing the Assembly five months after the Fourth Congress of the FRELIMO Party,  which made a thorough review of the international situation and concluded with great concern that:  Imperialist circles have reintroduced on the international scene the climate of the cold war, while at the same time they promote the arms race at an unprecedented scale, increase the areas and sectors of tension and conflict, resort to intervention and overt military aggression and make use of pressure and economic blackmail."
38,1983,MOZ,In our continent we witness the intervention of foreign forces in the internal affairs of countries even when Africa is in a condition to solve the problems that arise.
38,1983,TCD,"Therefore, we call on the international community, in keeping with the Charter of the United Nations, to help Chad regain its dignity, territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty, making Qaddafi's Libya see reason, cease its acts of aggression and intervention in our internal affairs and withdraw forthwith from Chad its invasion and occupation forces."
38,1983,LBR,I could not conclude this intervention without reaffirming my country's commitment to the principles and goals of the United Nations.
38,1983,DOM,"The Dominican Republic, which has always maintained a policy of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States and is convinced that this is the essential basis of peace, is concerned at the foreign intervention in Chad, in Afghanistan and in Kampuchea in violation of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations."
38,1983,KEN,"Both countries, in the view of my Government, are victims of foreign interference and intervention."
38,1983,KEN,Kenya deplores any foreign interference and intervention in matters that are exclusively internal to any given State.
38,1983,KEN,"This region is faced with serious political, social and economic crises, greatly aggravated by external intervention."
38,1983,BDI,"Indeed, respect for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-aligned status of Afghanistan, as well as the principle of non-intervention, are the basis for any equitable settlement of a conflict that has gone on for too long."
38,1983,JPN,It is already nearly four years since the Soviet Union launched its military intervention in Afghanistan.
38,1983,IRL,The situation created in Afghanistan by the Soviet intervention continues to be a source of both regional tension and international concern.
38,1983,KWT,Kuwait demands the implementation of the Security Council resolutions which call for the unconditional and immediate withdrawal of Israel from Lebanon and the cessation of all intervention in the internal affairs of that sister country and of all efforts to provoke trouble and feuds among its people.
38,1983,KWT,"The Council expressed the natural truth that the preservation of the peace, security and stability of the Gulf area is the collective responsibility of its States, without foreign intervention of any kind."
38,1983,KWT,Kuwait therefore would like to see the Muslim people of Afghanistan exercise its right to independence free from foreign intervention.
38,1983,KWT,"We look forward with hope to the success of the United Nations efforts to restore normal life to Afghanistan and to settle the Kampuchean problem by peaceful means, without resorting to any acts that may justify foreign intervention."
38,1983,KWT,The racist regime is not even satisfied with this; it also seeks to follow a policy of hegemony and intervention in the affairs of neighbouring African countries.
38,1983,EGY,"The country's national unity and territorial integrity have been compromised and its social peace undermined, while it has become a vulnerable target of foreign intervention, plots and dissension."
38,1983,EGY,We are determined that all forms of foreign intervention should be terminated and that all plans to partition Lebanon and turn it into spheres of influence and control must be rejected.
38,1983,EGY,"Furthermore, its continuance means more tension and more instability for the strategic Gulf area and provides a pretext for more foreign intervention and ambitions."
38,1983,EGY,"Another issue that should command our attention is the situation arising from the foreign intervention in Chad, with its repercussions on the peace, security and stability of the area, the killing of innocent civilians, the revival of the outmoded concepts of spheres of influence and the use of the fact accompli and attempts at partition and fragmentation."
38,1983,EGY,We pledge our support to the efforts of the Organization of African Unity to put an end to foreign intervention in Chad and to enable its people to direct their energies to the challenge of reform and reconstruction.
38,1983,SYR,We believe that the Afghan Government is entitled to defend the independence of Afghanistan against all kinds of outside intervention in its internal affairs.
38,1983,BEL,"The meeting was held in circumstances made extremely difficult by the continuance and even intensification of the Soviet armed intervention in Afghanistan, which we condemn, and by the course of events in Poland, where it has not yet been possible to bring about the national consensus which alone can enable all the spiritual and social forces of the country to participate in its rebuilding in an appropriate climate of freedom."
38,1983,MDG,"Here lies the essence of non-alignment, which cannot be reduced to a mere balancing act but rather presupposes the rejection of all forms of subjection, dependence, interference, intervention or pressure in international relations, in order to be able to judge according to merit on the basis of national independence and commitments based on universally accepted principles."
38,1983,COL,"In all three continents unjustified outside intervention is endangering peace, fomenting hatred, enriching arms merchants and provoking violence."
38,1983,COL,"Notwithstanding the particular characteristics of each case, those conflicts have in common the factor of foreign intervention, whether as a root cause or as a concomitant element."
38,1983,ISR,"In Afghanistan, Kampuchea foreign intervention continue, with hundreds of thousands having been killed or injured thus far and millions rendered homeless."
38,1983,SOM,The trend towards foreign military intervention in the affairs of States is of course one which runs counter to fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
38,1983,SOM,We regret that in Democratic Kampuchea too the aspirations of the people to national independence continue to be obstructed by foreign intervention and that this situation has escalated regional tensions.
38,1983,SOM,"In the political sphere States have become more vulnerable to intervention and interference, and tension and conflicts are on the increase in every part of the world."
38,1983,TUN,"It is essential that the language of guns and bombs be replaced by the language of dialogue and negotiation between the parties concerned, on the basis in particular of respect for the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-intervention in the internal affairs of States."
38,1983,VNM,It is evident that the fabrications about  Communist aggression  are designed to falsify the essence of the struggle for independence and freedom of the peoples of Central America and to provide a pretext for intervention and aggression.
38,1983,VNM,"It is necessary to put an end to acts of intervention and aggression in Central America, the Middle East and other regions of the world while there is still time."
38,1983,VNM,"Any effective solution must lead to the termination of the absolutely intolerable state of affairs in which the three Indo-Chinese countries have for the past 40 years constantly been the victims of aggression and intervention, and must guarantee a lasting peace and the independence and sovereignty of all the countries of Southeast Asia free of any outside interference."
38,1983,VNM,During the past 40 years in South-East Asia Thailand has always allied itself with the aggressor and its territory constantly has been used as a base for foreign intervention and aggression against the three countries of Indo-China.
38,1983,VNM,"The ASEAN countries demand that Kampuchea be neutralized, while Thailand and some other ASEAN countries continue freely to put themselves at the service of foreign aggression and intervention against the three Indo-Chinese countries."
38,1983,ARG,"As a Latin American country, Argentina has a serious fraternal concern regarding the critical situation in Central America, which is characterized especially by political destabilization, violence, the constant threat of armed conflict among sister nations, and foreign intervention."
38,1983,ARG,"In the face of this situation, my country once again reiterates its unchangeable position of full respect for the fundamental principle of non-intervention."
38,1983,ARG,"We are also determined to find a solution to the territorial dispute with the Republic of Chile in the southern zone, with the most valuable intervention of His Holiness John Paul II as mediator."
38,1983,SUR,"Respect for sovereignty, the right of all peoples to self-determination in all its aspects and the principles of non-interference and non-intervention, which are so strongly advocated by the Non-Aligned Movement, to which my country belongs, should be the paramount and guiding principles governing relations among States."
38,1983,SUR,I have more than once stressed in my statement the significance that our Government attributes to the principle of non-interference and non-intervention in the internal affairs of States.
38,1983,PRT,"The elementary norms of international law enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which ought to be respected by all Member States, continue to be infringed on in countries such as Afghanistan and Kampuchea, where the continued intervention of foreign military groups hinders the free exercise of the sovereign will of their respective peoples."
38,1983,PRT,My country's firm devotion to the principle of the peaceful and negotiated resolution of conflicts using all the mechanisms provided for in the Charter of the United Nations led Portugal to be a sponsor last year of a resolution adopted by the Assembly requesting the Secretary- General's intervention in the question of East Timor.
38,1983,PRT,Recent news of the increase of military operations in East Timor and of the difficulties raised concerning the intervention of the International Red Cross justify a growing concern on the part of Portugal and of the world public.
38,1983,PRT,"That is why I do not want to end this intervention without referring to the heavy responsibility resting on the United Nations; precisely because it is the most universal of all international organizations, and especially on its Secretary-General, whose report is once again proof of the distinguished and well-balanced way in which he has carried out his mandate."
38,1983,SDN,"It is clear that this session is taking place at a time when the international situation is very complex and in a climate characterized by numerous hotbeds of tension, war, instability, mutual mistrust, foreign intervention in the affairs of others and the use of force."
38,1983,SDN,"Since the Sudan has adopted the policy of good-neighborliness and non-intervention in the affairs of others as a cardinal principle of its foreign policy, it is only natural that we have been greatly concerned over the aggression against Chad, an aggression that violates that principle and threatens the sovereignty and independence of a Member State of this Organization."
38,1983,SDN,"We hope that, with the support of the OAU and of the international community, the legitimate Government of Chad will be able to settle its internal problems without any foreign intervention and to direct its efforts to problems of reconstruction."
38,1983,SDN,"We have also called for a peaceful settlement of the conflict between North and South Korea and between the two communities in Cyprus, through dialogue and in accordance with the wishes and aspirations of their peoples, without any foreign intervention."
38,1983,CMR,"Such a process presupposes the renunciation of threats, of the use of force, of intervention and interference, an end to all forms of aggression, withdrawal from occupied territories and the final elimination of colonialism and racism."
38,1983,CMR,"In addition to these long-standing situations so fraught with danger to peace and security, there are new crises caused by foreign intervention in the Mediterranean and in South-West Asia."
38,1983,PNG,Small countries have a right to be free from invasion or other forms of unwanted intervention from outside.
38,1983,PNG,The right to be free from foreign invasion or intervention is absolutely basic to any concept of lasting international order.
38,1983,NLD,"That country, faced with armed intervention, had recourse to the Security Council without gaining any satisfaction on its fully justified complaint."
38,1983,NLD,Its constant pattern of armed intervention in neighbouring countries and repression of internal opposition forces obliges us to deprive it of any assistance in the field of the manufacture or acquisition of arms.
38,1983,BRB,Another manifestation of the phenomenon of forcible intervention in the affairs and territory of weaker States is the repeated attacks by South Africa on the front-line States.
38,1983,BRB,We have no hesitation in endorsing the reaffirmation made by heads of State and Government at New Delhi this year of the need for strict adherence to the principles of non-intervention and non-interference in the affairs of other States.
38,1983,DEU,The continuing Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the Vietnamese intervention in Cambodia place a particularly heavy strain on international relations.
38,1983,JAM,In South-East Asia foreign intervention and its consequences have led to persistent conflict and are the source of tension in relations among States in the region.
38,1983,JAM,"In our view decades and even centuries of poverty, social inequalities, neglect and economic underdevelopment have in more recent times been further aggravated by foreign interference and intervention in that region."
38,1983,CPV,"That is why the Government of Cape Verde has based its conduct on the relentless defence of the principles of non-alignment and on the charters of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity, on non-intervention in the internal affairs of other countries, on the search for relations of mutually advantageous cooperation and on the protection of the prerogatives of sovereignty, independence and freedom of thought and action."
38,1983,NGA,"Localized disputes in these areas have been aggravated by foreign intervention, thus making it increasingly difficult for our continental organization, the OAU, to exercise fully its functions and responsibilities for resolving those disputes."
38,1983,NGA,Their intervention has added to the suffering and misery of the people of Chad.
38,1983,NGA,The people of Chad must be allowed to resolve their differences without any external intervention.
38,1983,NGA,My Government strongly deplores direct intervention in the internal affairs of Nicaragua and other Central American States by a certain Power.
38,1983,DZA,"Only if there is an end to such intervention in all its forms and manifestations will the people of Chad be able to decide, without constraint or hindrance, on a settlement of their problem."
38,1983,AFG,The replacement of Israeli forces in Beirut by the contingents of NATO countries and their brazen intervention in the internal hostilities have added seriously to the concern that the conflict in Lebanon may quickly become internationalized.
38,1983,AFG,"Continuation of that senseless bloodshed, which has already led to enormous material and human losses, can only serve the interests of imperialism by providing it with a pretext for military intervention in the region."
38,1983,AFG,"I should like to conclude with some words of Babrak Karmal, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan and President of the Revolutionary Council of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, who said that peaceful relations with all countries and peoples of the world, including our neighbours, on the basis of internationally recognized principles of peaceful coexistence, non-interference and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States, respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and national independence, friendship and co-operation remain the prime objectives of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan."
38,1983,FJI,Only through the unconditional withdrawal of foreign forces and the elimination of all forms of outside intervention can peace by attained.
38,1983,DJI,"We insist that any agreement concerning the people of Chad should protect them from any intervention, interference or domination from abroad."
38,1983,DJI,"Military intervention and domination have created a tragic situation in Afghanistan, threatening peace and security in that part of the world and thus contributing to the deterioration in international relations."
38,1983,DJI,"The continuing presence of these forces has created a precedent jeopardizing the principles of non-intervention and noninterference, as well as the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-aligned status of the States of the region."
38,1983,DJI,"We are convinced that the only way to put an end to the tragedy of Afghanistan is to respect those principles and to call for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan so that the people of that country may once again enjoy the right to choose their own political, economic and social system free from outside intervention and so that the Afghan refugees may return freely to their homes in peace and in dignity."
38,1983,BTN,"Nevertheless, continued international interference and intervention in Lebanon's affairs by external forces gives us much cause for alarm."
38,1983,BTN,Bhutan has always opposed foreign interference and intervention in the affairs of sovereign States.
38,1983,CUB,"Those who are against solving the problems of Central America through negotiated non-military solutions and whose brutal international policy supports the Salvadorian regime which has caused tens of thousands of deaths among the civilian population of El Salvador in recent years; those who see fit to disrupt the process of social change in Nicaragua, even if to do this they must carry out direct or indirect military intervention against that country; those who trained, instigated and supported the individuals who then committed a barbarous act of sabotage against a Cuban civilian aircraft over Barbados; those who stood by in silent complicity when, in February 1973, Israel shot down a Libyan passenger aircraft, causing 108 deaths, over Egyptian territory occupied by force; those who encouraged the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and must share responsibility for the genocidal acts which, a little over a year ago, left thousands dead in the Palestinian camps of Sabra and Shatila; those who support the South African racists in their illegal occupation of Namibia and their aggression against Angola and the front-line States, which have cost tens of thousands of lives; those whose spy-planes have been flying over Cuban territory for many years, shamelessly and openly violating our airspace, using first the U-2 aircraft and now the more sophisticated SR-71, flying provocatively over the whole island and trying in vain to frighten our people; those who do not even reply to the notes of protest sent by our Government, the most recent of which was in September this year—those it is who now hypocritically rend their garments and accuse the Soviet Union of an act whose roots lie in the international tension which they themselves create and in an act of provocation in which a commercial aircraft was used without any qualms and innocent people were sacrificed."
38,1983,CUB,"Under the pretext of joint military manoeuvres with other countries of the area, the duration of which has no parallel in history, the United States Government is attempting to create an intimidating situation which constitutes a real and dangerous intervention in the area and irrefutable proof of its aggressive militarist policy."
38,1983,CUB,"In the same way, Guatemala is becoming a possible springboard for Yankee military intervention in the area."
38,1983,CUB,United States and Israeli military aid to Guatemala is destined to strengthen the army in its effort to annihilate the Guatemalan revolutionary movement and to prepare it for the eventual intervention in El Salvador and Nicaragua.
38,1983,CUB,We support the spirit and proposals of the Contadora Group to find a political solution based on respect for the sovereignty of peoples and on non-intervention in the internal affairs of States.
38,1983,CUB,"With that in mind, I should like to quote the following words of Fidel Castro from an informal talk with a group of American journalists:  I agree with Contadora's proposal to seek a political solution based on respect for the sovereignty of States and on non-intervention in the internal affairs of States."
38,1983,YUG,"Interference in internal affairs of other States, military intervention and other forms of encroachment upon the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries are in the process of becoming common practice."
38,1983,YUG,"Just and lasting solutions of these crises require the elimination of the policy of faits accomplis and of positions acquired by force, the withdrawal of occupation troops, the cessation of all intervention and interference in the internal affairs of other States and, of course, the exercise by peoples of their right to free development."
38,1983,YUG,"They are with ever greater resolve resisting domination, hegemony, occupation, interference and intervention."
38,1983,PAK,"In our immediate neighbourhood, a small independent non-aligned State, Afghanistan, has been subjected to foreign military intervention."
38,1983,PAK,Yet they also look to the international community to ensure respect for the sacrosanct principles of non-use of force and non-intervention in international relations and to help them regain their sovereignty and freedom.
38,1983,PAK,"A direct and tragic consequence of the foreign military intervention in Afghanistan is the continuing exodus to neighbouring countries of millions of helpless men, women and children, who have been forced to flee from oppression at home and to seek shelter abroad."
38,1983,PAK,"The essential elements of a peaceful settlement are: the immediate withdrawal of the foreign troops from Afghanistan; the preservation of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and non-aligned character of Afghanistan; the right of the Afghan people to determine their own form of government and to choose their economic, political and social system free from outside intervention, subversion, coercion or constraint of any kind whatsoever; and the creation of necessary conditions to enable the Afghan refugees to return voluntarily to their homes in safety and honour."
38,1983,PAK,"Accordingly, our concern for peace is not restricted to our vicinity or our region; we are opposed to the use of force, whether it be in Kampuchea, where outside intervention has prevented the people of that country from exercising their right to shape their own future, in the conflict over the South Atlantic, the threat of intervention in Central America or the circumstances of war and intervention in Chad."
38,1983,CSK,"It is, moreover, deplorable that Washington is resorting here to direct armed intervention in an effort to expand a military-strategic bridgehead to allow it to interfere in the entire region."
38,1983,ITA,"I wish to point out that the increased levels of offensive weapons in the area, foreign intervention, traffic in weapons and hostile propaganda campaigns are not conducive to peace, nor will they restore the right of the peoples of Central America to live and work constructively and to exercise independent political choices."
38,1983,ITA,"Although the crisis in Chad stems from internal tensions, the decisive intervention of an external destabilizing factor has had a dangerous multiplier effect."
38,1983,YMD,"Within the framework of our steadfast foreign policy, which stems from the principles of peaceful coexistence, and is based on respect for national sovereignty and independence, and non-intervention in the internal affairs of others, Democratic Yemen is establishing balanced and friendly relations with its neighbours within the region and with numerous countries in the world."
38,1983,YMD,"The United States military intervention in Lebanon demonstrates the dangers facing our Arab peoples, as represented by the United States military presence in bases and war fleets in Arab territories and waters, which would take people back to the age of colonialism and endanger the security and stability of our Arab people as well as their sovereignty, independence and progress."
38,1983,YMD,"The peoples of Latin America are facing the military build-up, economic embargo and intervention in their internal affairs imposed by the United States Government, which aspires to impose on them its political and economic domination."
38,1983,YMD,"We condemn any imperialist intervention in the internal affairs of Afghanistan and Kampuchea, and we appeal for respect for their rights to independence, sovereignty and stability."
38,1983,YMD,"In Chad, we support the efforts of the OAU to resolve the problems of that country and we condemn imperialist attempts to impede a peaceful and rapid solution by an escalation of military intervention that threatens the security of the people and the territorial integrity of Chad."
38,1983,IND,"The sufferings of the people of Lebanon, caused by the intervention of foreign forces, have been of great concern to all of us."
38,1983,HUN,"The Hungarian Government attaches great importance to a peaceful solution of the question of Cyprus that will accord with the interests of both communities in the island country, guarantee sovereignty and the non- aligned status of the Republic of Cyprus and rule out any intervention from without."
38,1983,YEM,"While the Tel Aviv Government has decided to occupy the southern part of Lebanon without regard for international laws and norms or for the resolutions of this Organization, the intervention by force of the United States of America in the internal conflict in this helpless State in support of one part of its population against another represents, in our view, a serious development in the policy of Washington in the area, the consequences and implications of which should not be underestimated either for the security of the area or for the relationship between the United States and the States of the area."
38,1983,YEM,"The return by the great Powers to the policy of the cold war and rivalry in acquiring spheres of influence, intervention in the internal affairs of other States and the use of force for the settlement of international disputes are to us sources of both concern and sorrow."
38,1983,YEM,"It calls for the settlement of the problems among the States of the area through negotiation and dialogue so that they may apply themselves to dealing with questions of development, prevent any foreign intervention in their affairs and avoid being dragged into the conflict between the great Powers."
38,1983,YEM,"As a first stage, all forms of intervention in the internal affairs of Afghanistan should cease, and the refugees should return to their homeland."
38,1983,YEM,"As regards the Korean question, my country supports the continuance of serious dialogue between the Governments of North and South Korea for the reunification of Korea on a sound democratic basis, free from outside intervention."
38,1983,YEM,"Therefore it makes painstaking and concerted efforts for the unity of the Arab ranks with a view to uniting potentials and abilities for the service of our common goals, with a genuine desire for non-intervention in the internal affairs of others and separating itself from blocs and axes whose effects are detrimental."
38,1983,YEM,"Because of our commitment to the principle of non-alignment, our country has pursued an open-door policy with any country regardless of the social or economic philosophy of the regime of that country and on the basis of non-intervention and mutual respect."
38,1983,SYC,"The United Nations, indeed, played an important role by severely condemning the armed intervention by mercenaries of which we were the victim in November 1981."
38,1983,LBN,"In the face of this propaganda and through eight years of bloodshed, economic ruin and foreign intervention of every sort, it is proof of our inevitable viability as a nation that no Lebanese faction has ever entertained the idea of partition or secession."
38,1983,MDV,"It is with alarm, dismay and frustration that we witness the increasing instances of foreign intervention in areas of Africa and Latin America."
38,1983,MDV,"As we see it, there is not much of a difference in direct or indirect intervention or interference."
38,1983,TUR,Nothing could better illustrate the fact that the Afghan people reject categorically the foreign domination imposed on them by military intervention.
38,1983,TUR,The present conflict has been the result of the constant political and military intervention of Greece and of her ambition to dominate the island.
38,1983,GNQ,"We believe that it is the inhabitants of those countries first and foremost who must seek comprehensive solutions to their internal problems through peaceful negotiations, since the intervention of third countries not resulting from the free expression of the will of the indigenous inhabitants must be condemned as contrary to the Charter."
38,1983,LBY,"Today we are witnessing flagrant intervention by American troops in Lebanon, while United States military manoeuvres abound in several Arab countries."
38,1983,LBY,This intervention serves the goal of fostering American domination and hegemony and expanding its spheres of influence.
38,1983,LBY,The situation in Lebanon has deteriorated recently as a result of increased flagrant American intervention and the fact that the United States and French troops are siding with one of the warring factions.
38,1983,LBY,"The people of Chad almost realized their aims and the civil war would have ended during the last two months had it not been for the hysterical intervention of the colonialist powers which sent thousands of their soldiers and hundreds of mercenaries into Chad, supported by warplanes and a variety of weapons to protect the rebel, Hissein Habre, after he ran out of both troops and popular backing."
38,1983,LBY,The French and American intervention in Chad under the pretext of maintaining peace has only produced further deterioration in the situation there and the internationalization of the civil war.
38,1983,LBY,This was due to the fact that the American intervention was not meant for peace.
38,1983,LBY,"That intervention in Chad corresponds with the United States' declared policy of creating new hotbeds of tension as well as gaining new spheres of influence, even at the expense of its allies, not to mention its disregard for the will of the Chadian people themselves."
38,1983,LBY,"My country also supports the legitimate aspirations of the Korean people to the peaceful reunification of their land and calls for the creation of the appropriate conditions to that end, such as non-intervention in internal affairs and the withdrawal of American troops from the southern part of Korean territory."
38,1983,LBY,"As a result, an explosive international situation has arisen, increasing dependence on power, military pressure and intervention against independent countries as well as the sense of insecurity among all nations, particularly the developing one;."
38,1983,CHN,They want to eliminate intervention by external forces and call for a settlement of the internal dispute in Chad through negotiations.
38,1983,CHN,"We believe the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Chad should be respected, its internal affairs should be settled by the people of Chad themselves and all foreign intervention must cease forthwith."
38,1983,UKR,This armed intervention by the United States must be stopped and Israel must withdraw from Lebanon without any conditions that would infringe the independence and sovereignty of that country.
38,1983,UKR,"The world public is gravely concerned about the exacerbation of the situation in Central America, where the United States has launched a campaign of military threats and brutal pressure against sovereign States and national liberation movements that it finds objectionable, and where it is trying to keep anti-people puppet regimes in power and carrying out military intervention against Nicaragua."
38,1983,VEN,Non-intervention attains its true expression when it is based on the full exercise of self-determination.
38,1983,VEN,"Self- determination is the foundation of non-intervention, because, starting from the principle that man is free, it follows that peoples must be free also."
38,1983,VEN,"There can be no excuse for invoking non-intervention in order to deprive peoples of their freedom, since universal solidarity, whose roots lie in one and the same human condition, prevails over national differences."
38,1983,VEN,"If we, the peoples of the third world, have been the most active defenders of non-intervention as a fundamental principle of international order and of coexistence between nations, it hay been precisely because intervention practiced by powerful nations has prevented the will of our peoples from being unreservedly expressed."
38,1983,VEN,Today we consider the principle of non-intervention to mean that every people may exercise its right to self-determination.
38,1983,VEN,We cannot accept non-intervention as a rhetorical expedient under the cover of which some people or groups of people thwart the will of the peoples.
38,1983,BLZ,"They also inform our conduct of international affairs, where the basic rules are respect for the right of peoples to self- determination, non-interference and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States, non-violence and the peaceful settlement of disputes."
38,1983,MUS,We are convinced that the sectarian violence in that war-weary country would come to an end if all foreign intervention was to cease.
38,1983,ECU,"My country has witnessed with much distress the Central American conflict generated by the authoritarian and exploitative regimes which held sway in the region, a conflict which today is promoted by foreign intervention intent on ending the East-West conflict."
38,1983,ECU,"Ecuador has maintained, and will continue to advocate, the imperative need for an end to colonial intervention in the Malvinas Islands; for the withdrawal of foreign troops operating in Afghanistan, Lebanon, Cyprus, Kampuchea, Namibia, Chad and other areas; for an end to the cruel military conflict between Iran and Iraq; and for a negotiated solution for the problems of the Middle East, in particular of the Palestinian people."
38,1983,PER,"In this respect, we believe that the principles of the legal equality of States, non-intervention and self-determination of peoples, and respect for treaties, are essential for the maintenance of international peace and security."
38,1983,PER,"Instead of conciliatory attitudes, we are met with positions of strength and acts of overt or covert intervention which violate the sovereign equality, independence and sovereignty of States."
38,1983,PER,"Such solutions must be based on a recognition of the economic and social problems that the inhabitants of the region confront, on respect for the sovereignty and independence of the States concerned, that is, non-intervention, on the self-determination of the peoples, and on the agreement and reconciliation of the parties, as advocated by the Contadora Group, which my country resolutely supports."
38,1983,PER,"We condemn the intervention in and military use of Lebanon, and call for the full independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country."
38,1983,BEN,"Accordingly, we condemn all foreign intervention in Chad, for such intervention only exacerbates the difficulties and the suffering of the Chadian people."
38,1983,BEN,"For these reasons, the delegation of the People's Republic of Benin proposes for the settlement of this fratricidal conflict: first, the preservation of the de facto ceasefire in the field through its immediate confirmation and ironclad guarantees; secondly, the withdrawal of all foreign troops; thirdly, non-intervention in the internal affairs of Chad; and fourthly, national reconciliation under the auspices of the OAU."
38,1983,BEN,"We condemn any intervention in the internal affairs of those two countries, and appropriate measures should be examined and taken to eliminate foreign occupation and the threats to their security."
38,1983,BEN,"Our country is very much concerned over tensions resulting from a long history of exploitation and violation of human rights, aggravated in recent years by outside pressures and contempt for the principles  of non-intervention and non-interference."
38,1983,CRI,Its neutrality is a result of its respect for the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States and the fact that 35 years ago it banned the army as a permanent institution in order to devote its resources—as I have already pointed out—to social programmes of great priority.
38,1983,PRY,"It hopes to live in peace with all nations and to maintain friendly cultural and trade relations with them on the basis of juridical equality, of non-intervention in internal affairs, and of the self-determination of peoples."
38,1983,PRY,Such attitudes are contrary to the peoples' right to self-determination and the principle of non-intervention in their internal affairs.
38,1983,GTM,and in the principle of non-intervention in the affairs of other States.
38,1983,GTM,"Its guiding principles are based on the ideals of democracy and respect for human, civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights; international co-operation as a prime factor in accelerating the integrated, harmonious development of peoples; the elimination of the social injustice which exists in today's world; solidarity with just causes and attachment to the principles of international law, foremost among them those of the sovereign equality of all nations, non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States, territorial integrity, the peaceful settlement of international disputes, the self- determination of peoples and the fostering of international social justice."
38,1983,GTM,"It is not, nor will it be, a possible springboard for any military intervention, as one country suggested, nor is it, as that country is, a spokesman for any Power nor a gratuitous defender of hegemonic positions."
38,1983,GTM,"My delegation considers that the presence of occupation forces in that country violates the basic principles of international law, jeopardizes peace and seriously threatens the right of self-determination of peoples and the principle of non-intervention in the internal or external affairs of other countries."
38,1983,ESP,"Our domestic policy is accompanied by a determined and punctilious foreign policy, since we believe that it is clearly established in the United Nations that the systematic violations of human rights are not covered by Article 2, paragraph 7, of the Charter and that, accordingly, intervention in this field cannot be regarded as interference in the internal affairs of another State."
38,1983,ESP,My Government trusts that the coastal States of the Mediterranean will be able to create a stable framework which will ensure that any possible conflicts in the area will not lead to intervention by outside Powers tempted to resolve problems in the light of their global interests at the expense of the interests of the countries directly involved.
38,1983,NIC,"We appeal for respect of the cease-fire so that progress can be made toward reconciliation among all forces and sectors of that nation, in order to safeguard its sovereignty and end the increasingly direct intervention of the Powers currently involved there."
38,1983,NIC,From that time in the history of our peoples there were to be one landing of American soldiers after another and acts of direct intervention by the United States in our lands aimed at propping up tyrannical Governments and drowning the peoples' struggle in blood.
38,1983,NIC,"The acts of aggression against Nicaragua continue and are stepped up; there are threats, intimidation and intervention; there is an attempt to place the so-called vital interests of a great Power above the delicate efforts being made to achieve peace and coexistence in Central America on the basis of full respect for the sovereignty of all nations in the region."
38,1983,NIC,"Whenever Nicaragua has been attacked and invaded it has defended itself, it has struggled, it has fought, and we Nicaraguans will always be ready to confront, resist and defeat new imperialist intervention."
38,1983,OMN,"We demand that these acts of intervention in the affairs of the region be stopped immediately, to prevent its falling victim to expansionist attempts by foreign Powers to dominate African States and exploit them politically, economically and militarily."
38,1983,OMN,In Central America we have seen how foreign forces from outside the Americas have sought to exploit the existing social and economic problems and use them as a pretext for intervention in the internal affairs of that area in order to gain new spheres of influence.
38,1983,MNG,"Acts of intervention against Nicaragua, Angola and Mozambique are being overtly committed."
38,1983,MNG,"These activities are in fact leading to the partition of Lebanon, turning parts of its territory into a springboard for intervention against Syria and the progressive forces of the region."
38,1983,MNG,"3 A political settlement can be achieved only if all forms of interference in the internal affairs of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, including armed interference, are completely eliminated and a reliable guarantee provided that such intervention will cease and not recur in the future."
38,1983,DNK,"Similarly, the armed Vietnamese intervention in Kampuchea almost five years ago remains a serious threat to peace and stability in South-East Asia."
38,1983,ZMB,We call for an immediate end to all foreign intervention and interference in the internal affairs of Chad and for all concerned to co-operate with the Organization of African Unity in its efforts to find a just and lasting solution.
38,1983,ZMB,We believe that the problems of the two countries have arisen because of failure to respect the principles of non-interference and non-intervention in the affairs of States.
38,1983,AUS,Australia believes that solutions to the problems of this region lie in the maintenance of the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States and in the efforts directed towards domestic reforms and reconciliation.
38,1983,IRN,"The only way to settle the Afghanistan problem lies in the complete, unconditional and immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces from Afghanistan, the non-intervention of other forces in the internal affairs of that country, the return of Afghan refugees to their homeland and the guarantee of the right of the people of Afghanistan to determine their own destiny."
38,1983,IRN,"The unobstructed brazen intervention of Big Satan in the internal affairs of the countries of this region, especially in Nicaragua and El Salvador, not only has violated the principles of the Charter of the United Nations in a most shameless manner but also is threatening the peace and security of the world we live in."
38,1983,IRN,"We declare our full support for these liberation movements against American imperialism, and we believe that the decisions of the Contadora Group may serve as a suitable basis for the solution of problems in Latin America and the cessation of external intervention and aggression."
38,1983,ATG,"Closer to my own home, foreign military intervention in Central America is helpful only in prolonging conflict."
38,1983,MEX,Lasting peace in Central America can be achieved only by means of full respect for the principles of the self- determination of peoples and of non-intervention.
38,1983,MEX,"The equality of States under the law, self-determination and non-intervention are principles that cannot be abandoned and which imply rejection of the monopoly of power, the consolidation of spheres of influence and ideological intolerance."
38,1983,CYP,"The threat or use of force in international relations, military intervention and interference, the revival of the cold war, great-Power rivalry and the intensified arms race, especially in nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, constitute a gloomy picture of today's world."
38,1983,GRC,The civilian population has suffered greatly in the crossfire of the warring factions and by the intervention of foreign elements.
38,1983,GRC,"The 10 members of the European Community are gravely concerned by the outside intervention to which this country has fallen victim, and the consequences of that intervention."
38,1983,THA,"The delegation of Thailand reaffirms its full support for the calls by the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the General Assembly for the immediate and total withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan so that the Afghan people may be able to choose its form of government free from outside intervention, subversion, coercion or constraint of any kind."
38,1983,THA,"My delegation calls on all the parties concerned to proceed in good faith with the negotiations being conducted under the auspices of the Secretary-General and his special representative so that meaningful agreements can be reached on the four essential elements of withdrawal of foreign troops, non-interference by outside Powers in the internal affairs of Afghanistan, international guarantees of non-intervention, and the safe and voluntary return of Afghan refugees to their homeland."
38,1983,SAU,"These grounds are: the principle of national sovereignty, absolute rejection of any attempts to tamper with that sovereignty, and dealing with others on the basis of equality and refraining from any intervention in their internal affairs."
38,1983,SAU,"While my country supports all the efforts of the United Nations to reduce tension and conflict in various areas of the world, it condemns all attempts at external covert or overt intervention that can threaten the security and stability of other States."
38,1983,SAU,"Therefore, the ending of Israeli intervention in the internal affairs of Lebanon and the full and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Lebanese territories are prerequisites for the return of normal conditions to Lebanon and for dedicating all efforts once more towards establishing a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East."
38,1983,BFA,"It believes that every effort must be  made, under the auspices of the OAU, to bring about the unconditional withdrawal of foreign forces from Chad, to oppose all the imperialist and neo-colonialist enemies of Africa that advocate or encourage foreign intervention, in Chad, to assist Chad to recover its national unity, territorial integrity and national sovereignty, and to strive to unite all the vital forces of Chad for national reconstruction and economic and social development."
38,1983,GUY,"People therefore looked upon this Organization as a repository of their hopes and their aspirations to live in peace as free peoples, able to determine their own political, economic and social goals, free from external interference and intervention."
38,1983,GUY,"Too often, countries which espouse non-intervention practice intervention in one form or another."
38,1983,GIN,"In this necessarily incomplete survey of some problems connected with peace and stability in the world, it would only be fair to note that the current session, unfortunately, is taking place against a backdrop of alarming deterioration in the international situation, futures of which are confrontation, military intervention, foreign occupation and the spiralling arms race."
38,1983,BGR,"The military presence in, and direct intervention of, the imperialist States in the internal affairs of a number of countries pose a threat not only to the security of individual countries and regions, but also to world peace and security."
38,1983,BGR,"We resolutely call for a habit to the campaign of threats and provocations against Cuba, to the foreign intervention in Nicaragua, to any interference in the internal affairs of these and other countries of Central America."
38,1983,BGR,"The elimination of the imperialist intervention in Afghanistan, the establishment of a zone of peace and stability in South-East Asia and the peaceful reunification of Korea will contribute enormously to the strengthening of peace and security in Asia and throughout the world."
38,1983,AGO,"We repeat the question: how long will the peoples and Governments that cherish peace and justice have to wait before the existing United Nations bodies—which are adequate to the task—truly shoulder their responsibilities and firmly take the most effective measures, which they do indeed have at their disposal, against those who violate the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations; against those who carry on colonial wars and foment all sorts of acts of aggression, direct or indirect, the victims being States that take independent, progressive positions; against those who engage in the economic plunder of underdeveloped countries and who persist in preventing the gradual reduction of the gap which exists between the rich or developed countries and the poor or underdeveloped countries; against those who deliberately hinder the serious efforts of the socialist countries and the progressive, democratic forces to achieve detente, general and complete disarmament, and a comprehensive prohibition of the manufacture and use of weapons of mass destruction, in particular nuclear weapons; against those who stimulate the arms race, thus ensuring fabulous profits for their military industries and leading to faster increases in military budgets and expenditures; against those who engage in an ever-increasing number of gigantic military manoeuvres which are intended to intimidate certain peoples or States, or even to carry out acts of aggression against them; against those who do not respect relevant resolutions or decisions of the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Non-Aligned Movement and the OAU; against those who undermine the authority of the Secretary-General and his efforts to carry out his great responsibilities by failing to provide him with all the means of which he has need; and against those who threaten international peace and security through military intervention and illegal occupation of territories, through interference in the internal affairs of other States and through a lack of respect for the principles of non-use of force and the settlement of disputes by means of negotiations? 158."
38,1983,AGO,Chad must be spared from foreign intervention so that the people can decide without constraint or hindrance how best to solve their problem in keeping with the efforts of the OAU.
38,1983,AGO,"The central region of Latin America has experienced extremely disturbing developments as a result of threats and military intervention by the United States Government, particularly in Nicaragua and El Salvador."
38,1983,AGO,"We also reaffirm our support for the efforts of the Indo-Chinese countries to secure peace and stability in South-East Asia, without foreign intervention, and for a continuation of constructive dialogue between the parties to the conflict."
38,1983,HND,Thus we see examples of open intervention in El Salvador; attempts to destabilize the democratic Governments of Honduras and Costa Rica; an alarming increase in the armed forces of the Nicaraguan regime and statements by the Commanders who govern Nicaragua.
38,1983,HND,"I have referred to the principles of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States and of the self- determination of peoples, but the Government of Honduras considers that these principles must never be invoked to prevent the international community from taking note of and condemning the human rights violations which take place systematically in countries on various continents."
38,1983,ZWE,"Foreign intervention and occupation continue there, seriously threatening that country's sovereign independence, territorial integrity and the unity of its people."
38,1983,ZWE,"As a small country, holding very dear the principles of non-intervention and non-interference in the affairs of sovereign States, Zimbabwe is greatly disturbed whenever and wherever there is evidence of their violation, even if the violators are our friends."
38,1983,ZWE,"Accordingly, we must record our deep concern about foreign intervention and interference in Afghanistan, Kampuchea, on the Korean peninsula and in East Timor."
38,1983,ZWE,"We must observe, with deep regret, that in most instances, though not necessarily in all, the perpetrators of intervention and interference in the affairs of other States are permanent members of the Security Council who, by their position, should be most aware of the heavy and special responsibility for international peace and security which the Charter has placed on them."
38,1983,ZWE,"We call upon those concerned to leave the peoples of Afghanistan, Kampuchea, Korea and East Timor freely to exercise their right to determine their own social and political systems, and to choose their leaders without any intervention and interference."

36,1981,MEX,"From our point of view, the present crisis in relations between the superPowers can be traced to two recent causes: the armed intervention of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan; and the decision by NATO to install euro-missiles in response to the Soviet deployment of SS20 missiles."

The peoples of the world have a right to call upon them to stop the escalation of their verbal exchanges and fruitless polemics, to stop provoking each other, to stop the new and absurd arms race and, above all, to stop intervention or threats of interference in the internal affairs of other countries, in (lie name of the crusade that each of the superPowers has undertaken against the other; a right to call upon them to start immediate negotiations, to begin a dialog at the highest level, between the Governments of the United States and of the Soviet Union."
36,1981,MEX,"Thirdly, as President Lopez Portillo has said, the best proof of strength, representably and popular support for the El Salvador opposition is to be found precisely in the fact that the Government junta has felt constrained to call for foreign intervention in order to retain power, and other countries have felt obliged to respond favorably to that request."

36,1981,COL,"Others, as if it were an insignificant matter, allege that the supply of arms and military training to extremist organizations or terrorist groups (which act in the broad area of subversion with the open and declared purpose of destabilizing democratically constituted Governments and imposing by force on other countries the systems and ideologies that exist in the countries that assist and finance) does not constitute intervention or damage the juridical structure, which was so difficult to build and which is now threatened with destruction by the indifference of those who should be the most concerned by its gradual disappearance."
36,1981,COL,"It also considers that the fate of the Territory should be determined by its inhabitants, without the intervention or support of foreign Powers, In keeping with this position, it considers that the Government of South Africa has an inescapable obligation to bring about the independence of Namibia and not put obstacles in the way of its legitimate claim to self-government."

36,1981,DEU,"Yet and this is the disturbing part of it is not these problems that are the focal point of world politics and of world interests: the headlines of the international press tell us, rather, about an arms race and tensions between nations, about war, civil war and intervention."

36,1981,EGY,The continuation of foreign military intervention in the internal affairs of the people of Afghanistan constitutes a flagrant violation by a superPower of the sovereignty and independence of a small nonaligned country.

36,1981,MDG,"The new doctrine of a limited nuclear war, which is intended to make acceptable what is unthinkable, is accompanied by other decisions, such as those concerning the substantial and constant growth of military expenditures, the unilateral designation of so-called zones of vital interest, the extension of areas of intervention, not to mention such projects as the treaty of the southern Atlantic, in which the South African racist regime is the keystone."
36,1981,KWT,"The tendency to resort to the use of military force, or t* e threat of it, has increased substantially, to the extent that it has been coupled in some cases with military intervention and occupation."

36,1981,AFG,"Guided by the peaceful principles of its foreign policy and a sincere desire to defuse tension in the area and normalize relations with the neighboring countries, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan put forward, in May 1980, a realistic Program for a political settlement of the situation concerning Afghanistan which is the result of the imperialist policy of intervention and aggression."
36,1981,GTM,"In the early years of this century, it was the shadow of the Monroe Doctrine that, in creating a monopoly in Central American intervention, was also given expression by the presence of Marines."
36,1981,GTM,"From that same experience we know that if transitory there are local forces that sympathize with an intervention, they soon show themselves for what they truly are: ephemeral and inconsequential in the national destiny of Central America."
36,1981,GTM,"The cessation of all intervention in the five countries of Central America would not end that violence altogether but it would give the peoples of Central America an opportunity to defend their national values and bring them to fulfillment and to achieve a just peace in keeping with our spiritual, social, political and economic needs."

36,1981,SLV,"The road to the revitalization of the world Organization is not through intervention in the internal affairs of a State, or whatever pretext, because what is not permissible for any individual State is also prohibited for several or many States together, in accordance with the rule universally accepted in any code of international conduct that what concerns the institutional structure of a State or its future must be resolved exclusively by that State."
36,1981,LUX,"Why, I wonder, does the USSR persist in occupying an Afghanistan that is hostile to its ideological and expansionist designs? How many human and material resources are needed in the attempt to prove, in defiance of world public opinion, that intervention is ever justified? Apart from the fact that such interventions are contrary to the fundamental principles set forth in the Charter, such acts and interventions and here I am speaking on behalf of all the people of Luxembourg are contrary to the most elementary human rights."

36,1981,SDN,"In the international sphere, our commitment to the principles of the settlement of international disputes by peaceful means prompted our repeated appeals for just political settlements that would end the war that has been going on for more than a year now between two brother countries, Iraq and Iran; for a peaceful solution to the question of Afghanistan, ending the foreign intervention there and enabling the Afghan people to enjoy its right to freedom, independence, sovereignty and nonalignment; for the peaceful reunification of Korea in accordance with the legitimate aspirations of its people; and for the solution of the problem of Cyprus in such a way as to safeguard that country's independence, unity and territorial integrity, 246."
36,1981,CUB,"It is imperialism, with its direct or indirect military intervention through reactionary regimes, which must assume the responsibility for the absence of peace in Central America."
36,1981,CUB,"Cuba supports the Government and the people of Panama in its struggle for the implementation of the agreements on the Canal and supports the Guatemalan people, which has risen up in arms against the cruel tyranny imposed on it since the United States intervention of 1954."
36,1981,CUB,"Such a solution should, in our opinion, entail the end of intervention and interference in the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, together with the necessary international guarantees, and the creation of conditions permitting the normalization of relations among all States in the area on the basis of the principles and purposes of nonalignment."
36,1981,DZA,"The policy of spheres of influence, the doctrines of intervention based on a so-called vital interest, the installation or reactivation of military bases and the formation and deployment of armed forces for rapid intervention are all part of a firm desire to make the countries of the third world sites for the application of the global strategies directed fundamentally at the independence of those countries and their legitimate aspirations to peace."
36,1981,SWE,"The Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, the war between Iran and Iraq,, the terror and bloodshed in Iran, the conflict between Israel and the Arabs, the increased American and Soviet presence in the Indian Ocean, the arms flow to that region, the social and political unrest, the economic and strategic importance of the Middle East and Gulf region all these factors combine to make this part of the world a powder keg."

36,1981,ETH,"Furthermore, a new era of peace and stability cannot be ushered in by the rearming of a belligerent State and the establishment of military bases, or by the deployment of a rapid intervention force in that country."
36,1981,ETH,"The massive military buildup, the stockpiling and deployment of nuclear weapons, the acquisition of new military bases and the expansion of existing ones, the formation of rapid intervention forces, interference in the internal affairs of States, the use or threat of force and provocative military maneuvers characterize the present international scene."

36,1981,ISL,"I condemn in the strongest terms this military intervention and call for the immediate and total withdrawal of all foreign military forces, just as I support wholeheartedly the demand for total withdrawal of all Vietnamese invasion forces from Kampuchea where a war torn nation should be allowed to organize free elections."
36,1981,KEN,I say this because in the past many problems have been made more complex or more intractable by external intervention.
36,1981,IDN,"In this regard, we laud the efforts of the SecretaryGeneral, his Special Representative and other parties, as well as the constructive attitude shown by Pakistan, to facilitate negotiations to achieve a political solution and ensure that the Afghan people will be able to determine their own destiny free from foreign intervention and interference."

36,1981,CAN,"Is it possible that in the last 20 years the nature of EastWest tension has changed because the Soviet Union is today a military super-Power with a capability of intervention which ranges far and wide?

31,1976,PAN,"My country believes that the principle of non-intervention should be extended to all forms of intervention, regardless of semantic disguise, because there are other forms of intervention-far more effective than the armed variety that are carried out surreptitiously at economic and social levels."

And why does Israel insist on forcing its racial hegemony upon the Palestinian Arab people, whose just struggle the Assembly recognized and whose representation as an observer at the United Nations the Assembly thereupon accepted? 270."

31,1976,LKA,"If the non-aligned nations have acclaimed the victories of the peoples of Viet Nam, Laos and Kampuchea in their valiant struggles against the forces of reaction and intervention, it is because their success has been a vindication of the basic principles for which the non-aligned movement has fought for over two decades."
31,1976,LKA,"As do the political decisions of the Fifth Conference, these, too, derive from the same commitment of the non-aligned to principles of equality and sovereignty and opposition to all forms of domination, intervention and unequal relations in the economic sphere."
31,1976,LBN,Should we deal with the principles of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States and of safeguarding their independence and sovereignty at a time when our sovereignty has been torn to shreds and intervention in our affairs has become so flagrant? Are we to discourse on the responsibility of the United Nations to protect the small and the weak among its Members at a time when the faith of international public opinion in the United Nations ability to perform this primary duty has been shaken? Or are we expected to discuss the new international economic order and social development when the thriving economic life of Lebanon has come to a standstill? 55.

31,1976,TUN,"On the contrary, the hostility of the Government of Israel continues to pursue the Palestinians, not only inside occupied Palestine but even in Lebanon, where its disguised intervention and its intrigues are contributing to the worsening of an already complex situation, a situation that is all the more dangerous because it involves grave risks and a direct threat to international peace and security."

31,1976,NIC,"In those countries where freedom was achieved through the upheavals of revolution, it is there that we have seen most clearly the dangers of all forms of foreign intervention."
31,1976,NIC,"The presence of those external factors prevents the new directions taken by the people who have been victims of the intervention from being determined by the will of its citizens and, through subterfuges or overt violations of the right to self-determination, the forces of intervention impose on new States from abroad a particular foreign ideological policy which does not always reflect the interests, concerns and true needs of the people they say they have helped to liberate."
31,1976,MEX,"To achieve this, we added to the permanent vitality of the principles that emanate from our history-the sovereign equality of States, non-intervention and the self- determination of peoples-other innovative elements such as the broadening and diversification of our international relations, creative and responsible association in solidarity with the struggle of the developing countries that are generally grouped under the title of the ""third world"" and the campaign to establish and consolidate a new inter-national economic order based on sovereign equality, justice, equity and interdependence."

31,1976,CHL,We strongly denounce the failure of Soviet communism to abide by the principle of non-intervention; that failure is a threat to peace among nations and the major enemy of permanent and fruitful detente.
31,1976,CHL,"This violation has become manifest, as we have pointed out, not only through open intervention but also and much more frequently by helping to create critical conditions as a result of support in the form of both ideology and arms given to terrorist and extremist groups."
31,1976,CHL,This contemporary form of intervention in the internal policy of most of the countries of the world must be cogently condemned by the international community.
31,1976,CHL,We state this because we continue to be the victims of the Soviet Union's intervention in our own national political life.
31,1976,CHL,"If, to the intervention which we have just described and frequently denounced in the United Nations, we add the fact that we have found and continue to find thousands of arms manufactured in the Soviet Union in the hands of Chilean terrorist organizations, then we have the full picture of an obviously illegitimate and undeniable intervention."
31,1976,CHL,"We cannot fail to note this paralyzing and disorienting effect of Soviet communism, its lack of respect for the rights and duties enshrined in the Charter and, especially, its repeated violations of the principle of non-intervention in all continents, all of which have created a series of problems that prevent mankind from meeting its vital needs and have forced it to postpone the adoption of measures to solve these problems."

31,1976,YEM,"The United Nations, through its specialized committees, especially the Fourth Committee, which deals with decolonization, should take into consideration and supervise all political and constitutional initiatives envisaged for putting an end to injustice, terror, racial discrimination, apartheid and the white minority regimes, so as to enable the African majority to rule its own territory and people, in closer co-operation with the African Member States and with OAU, and to avoid the dangers arising from foreign intervention, which often have negative effects on the future of the peoples of the African continent."
31,1976,ISR,"One is the ludicrous and evil attempt to stigmatize the national liberation movement of the Jewish people as racism and racial discrimination; the other is the bizarre episode of the Committee of 20 members, from the resolution which the General Assembly was not competent to adopt; through the biased and non-representative com-position of the Committee itself, to the report of the Committee which is not only a flagrant intervention in the domestic jurisdiction of a Member State but also a prescription for its dismemberment by stages."
31,1976,ISR,"No one produces this specious argument now, when massive armed intervention by regular and irregular foreign Arab troops is known and admitted-Syrians, Iraqis and Libyans, to mention only the larger contingents."
31,1976,PER,"Latin America has not only contributed to the strengthening of self-determination and non-intervention as basic principles of international relations; when it faced obstacles to the consolidation of its republican personality, it confronted incessant threats from the centers of power to the juridical rationale of its incipient nationalism."

31,1976,NGA,"Secondly, Vorster has not relented in spite of the impression being created that he has ceased his intervention in propping up the racist regime in Zimbabwe."
31,1976,DDR,"In addition, it would render imperialist aggression and intervention much more difficult and would help to eliminate them finally."
31,1976,ARG,"Certainly, on not infrequent occasions it has been powerless to prevent the outbreak of local wars but even so, in many cases, its intervention has served to limit the extent or duration of the conflict."
31,1976,ARG,"Interdependence implies, first of all, recognition of the existence of different cultures, policies, ideologies, and legal and economic structures, it entails above all the obligation not to try to impose any system at the expense of another by force, by coercion or by any other form of outside intervention."

31,1976,TUR,"The Turkish intervention in Cyprus in July of 1974, which followed the coup d'etat against the independence of the island, was fully in conformity with the obligations undertaken by Turkey under a treaty which guaranteed that independence."

77,2022,MLI,"Further, we invite the French not to stop there, but to take a look back at their history: their intervention in Libya decried by all Africa, the forced participation of thousands of Africans in the First and Second World Wars, not to mention the slave trade, which explains the economic rise of many countries."
77,2022,CYP,"Therefore, while the aim of the Secretary-General to reach a strategic agreement was within close reach, the reason for the unsuccessful outcome was Turkey’s inflexible stance and its insistence on maintaining the anachronistic Treaty of Guarantee, the right of intervention and a permanent presence of troops."

50,1995,GEO,"Should we regard all the above-mentioned resolutions, decisions and statements as futile efforts that carry little beyond moral support? Or consider that the adoption of Security Council resolutions and their implementation are two separate and unconnected acts?

15,1960,GRC,"If today feeling runs high over the fate of the Congo (Leopoldville) or less important matters and if we feel anxious on the subject, how can we forget that in the last fifteen years we have lived through far more serious crises which have been settled thanks to the United Nations? Who among us can doubt that, in certain, crises of the post-war period, far more blood would have been shed and far more suffering would have been inflicted on mankind, without the intervention of this world body? 118."
15,1960,GRC,"We firmly believe that this can only be brought about if all nations abstain from any intervention in the Congo’s internal affairs, since any action along these lines will inevitably provoke interference by other parties and turn a peaceful and independent country in the heart of Africa into a vast battlefield of the cold war."

15,1960,GRC,"Co-operation, and even close co-operation, with countries having a different system of Government, is for us both possible and desirable, provided there is sincere and complete mutual respect for existing treaties and for the independence and dignity of others and non-intervention in their domestic affairs."
15,1960,MLI,"The fantastic legend of the ""Sahara fringe” is nothing more than a pretext for intervention along the Sahara frontier of my country — some 1,500 kilometres long — and exists only in the imagination of French activists who must know that Guinea and Mali, under-developed countries where colonialism has left nothing or almost nothing, cannot possibly solve the problems of organization, equipment and transport, particularly air transport, that would be involved in crossing the thousands of kilometres Of the Sahara in its most arid region, the Tanezrouft."

15,1960,CYP,"But for the timely intervention of the United Nations and its decisive action, there would have been chaos in the Congo with the risk of a widespread war."
15,1960,CYP,"Its intervention has already been most salutary in many explosive situations the world over; its economic activities throughout the world, though in their nature less dramatic, have been of great value."
15,1960,NLD,At this stage of the general debate I shall confine my intervention to the treatment of those questions which either have a special significance for my country or are such that the debate may perhaps profit from a statement of our views on them.
15,1960,TUN,"Need I recall that, thanks to the United Nations, more has been done in the Congo, in less than two months, to evacuate occupying troops than Tunisia has been able to do in five years of independence? Even today, a great bastion of our port system is still in the hands of occupying French troops, against the will of the Tunisian Government, despite two appeals to the Security Council, and notwithstanding the intervention and good offices of friendly countries."
15,1960,ARG,"In the Declaration of San José, Costa Rica, of 28 August 1960 we once again reaffirmed the principle of non-intervention because we think we should make it clear that our condemnation of outside interference does not imply any restriction on the right of every people to establish institutions in keeping with its character and traditions."
15,1960,ARG,Non-intervention further implies that no American State will seek to extend its internal regime to any other by means of subversion or violence.
15,1960,VEN,United Nations intervention has often stopped the spread of a conflict which might otherwise have led to a world conflagration.
15,1960,VEN,"We believe that for a prompt solution of the Congo conflict it is essential that all States, without exception, should refrain from any direct or indirect intervention in that conflict and, consequently, without prejudice to the sovereign rights of the Republic of the Congo, should send no arms or other war material, military personnel or other military aid, directly or indirectly, while the United Nations is temporarily providing military assistance to the country, except at the request of the United Nations made through the Secretary-General."
15,1960,COL,"All of us representing the other countries of America affirmed in clear and categorical terms that Cuba does not need the protection of the Soviet Union or of any other extra-continental Power, since its freedom of action is guaranteed by the principle of non-intervention which is the backbone of the inter-American system."
15,1960,COL,We therefore consider all attempts by the Soviet Union at political and military intervention in American affairs to be unjustifiable and inadmissible.
15,1960,COL,"Peaceful coexistence is not, however, helped, but is rather undermined, when countries violate or encourage the violation of the principle of non-intervention."
15,1960,COL,The position which we American Foreign Ministers adopted at San Jose consisted in rejecting and condemning every such attempt at extracontinental intervention in the problems of America.
15,1960,COL,"We must, nevertheless, emphasize that under the guise or pretext of such relations, we American peoples are not prepared to accept any act of extracontinental intervention in our continent, even should such an attempt be accompanied by the threatened use of guided missiles."
15,1960,COL,"At San José, Costa Rica, we reaffirmed the principle of non-intervention by any American State in the internal or external affairs of the other American States,, and we reiterated that each State has the right to develop its cultural, political and economic life freely and naturally, respecting the rights of the individual and the principles of universal morality."
15,1960,COL,"This example demonstrates that in rejecting extracontinental intervention, America is not applying to outside Powers a procedure different from that which it has applied to itself."
15,1960,COL,We frankly cannot accept as a criterion the anarchic policy of renouncing the principle of non-intervention.
15,1960,COL,Let me also reiterate that harmony and good relations between States can only be achieved if the principle of non-intervention is rigorously observed and respected.
15,1960,HTI,"The essential thing is to fight against bad ideas which spread sophism and error, and to defend, disseminate and inculcate ideas which foster principles, mould human values, and promote respect for non-intervention and the sovereignty of States."
15,1960,COG,"I do not think I am mistaken in saying that, under the terms of the resolution adopted by the Security Council on 22 July 1960 there can be no foreign intervention in the Congo (Leopoldville) except under United Nations supervision."
15,1960,BRA,"This acceptance must be accompanied by the pledge of non-intervention, direct or indirect, by one ideology in the sphere of another."
15,1960,THA,"One of the most recent cases, which I should like to mention, occurred a few days ago when a Government, which does not so far have diplomatic representation in a country of South-East Asia neighbouring on Thailand, accused the Government of Thailand of intervention in the affairs of that neighbouring country, of providing opposing forces with access to Thai territory, of concentrating military units on the border of that country and finally of firing from our boats on our neighbour's ships and troops."
15,1960,THA,"However, charges such as these are not completely devoid of meaning; in our opinion, they may well portend an open intervention by certain elements which have so far remained in concealment."
15,1960,THA,"There the possibility of intervention by one brings the likelihood of intervention by the other, and that leads to the danger of possible conflicts."
15,1960,GIN,"By its intervention in the Congolese conflict, the United Nations took a stand for justice against arbitrary action, for law against brute force, and, by so doing, placed itself at the disposal of the Congolese people so that they might be able to achieve their objective of living in peace despite the efforts of those who had taken the heavy responsibility of attacking them."
15,1960,GIN,"How then could the United Nations assert that it ""could not take sides in the internal affairs of the Congo"", since an appraisal of those internal affairs, characterized by foreign aggression, was the very justification for its intervention in the Congo? 36."
15,1960,GIN,"The United Nations intervention can accordingly be justified only by the fact that it was requested by a responsible Government, the Government of Mr."
15,1960,GIN,"How, then, can the object of this intervention be defined apart from the will of the Congolese Government on Congolese soil? Can we enter a man's room, with the avowed intention of offering him help against a bandit, an aggressor, and then claim the right to act in that room in complete disregard of the occupant's will and the conditions set by him? It often happens that the means becomes the end, but in this case we must frankly admit that might is stronger than law and justice."
15,1960,MMR,"Since this is my first intervention in the general debate, let me take this opportunity of extending through the Vice-President, the very warm felicitations of my delegation to Mr."
15,1960,MMR,It will be recalled that the original purpose of its intervention was to replace the Belgian troops and to hold the fort while order was being restored.
15,1960,USA,"Today the danger of war by miscalculation could be reduced, in times of crisis, by the intervention, when requested by any nation seeking to prove its own peaceful intention, of an appropriate United Nations surveillance body."
15,1960,IRQ,"Above all, Israel's presence and acts against the Arab countries have provided pretexts for the intervention of certain Powers, and an excuse for exercising pressure upon those countries."
15,1960,ESP,"""Neither in respect of Indians, nor of any other people, do the sins of the subject race give to foreign Powers the right of intervention,"" said Vitoria."
15,1960,ESP,"At Ibis very time, we have seen how, in the Congo (Leopoldville), that group has unleashed a campaign to discredit the world organization, the skilful work of the Secretariat and the combined and capable intervention of neutral armed forces."
15,1960,ESP,"It is their proselytizing activities outside their borders, their eager intervention in the politics of other nations, their imperialist ambition and their lack of scruple in using violence far beyond their own borders and in imposing their power indirectly, through infiltration, that make us suspect their public action."
15,1960,ALB,"The tragic events in the Congo,, the intervention in Laos, the innumerable crimes in South Viet-Nam, and the economic, political and military pressure on numerous other countries of the world — all this has its source in the aggressive policy of the reactionary imperialist circles, and first and foremost in the policy of the United States of America."
15,1960,ALB,"find a way to agree among themselves with regard to improving their mutual relations on the basis of equal rights, non-intervention, mutual respect and mutual (advantage, and according to the principle of peaceful coexistence,, The Albanian Government is ready to negotiate with the Greek Government for the establishment of normal relations between these two neighbour countries, Albania and Greece, but only subject to full equality of rights and the exclusion of political or territorial claims at each other’s expense."
15,1960,CHL,"Voicing the general aspiration of the American peoples to live in peace, under the protection of democratic institutions and free from any intervention or totalitarian influence, the twenty-one Foreign Ministers of the American Republics solemnly signed the Declaration of Santiago, Chile, which was approved at the Fifth Meeting of Consultation of Foreign Ministers."
15,1960,CHL,"The Declaration of San Jose, with the object of re-establishing solidarity in the hemisphere, reasserts principles which are common to the American States, such as non-intervention in the internal or external affairs of another State and the incompatibility of democracy with any form of totalitarianism, and recalls that all controversies between members of the Organization should be resolved by the measures that are contemplated in the inter-American system 90."
15,1960,PRY,"What was the result? Three invasions were immediately turned back, without any need for the intervention of the army or the police, since Paraguayan citizens of every political affiliation co-operated in repelling the invaders."
15,1960,IRL,"What form would the cold war then take? Would it not be likely to develop into what are described sometimes too airily as ""brush fire wars"" — wars which, though confined in space, may none the less become appalling national tragedies, like the Spanish war of 1936-1939 in which domestic antagonisms drew in the far greater destructive forces of foreign intervention on both sides? The prelude to the Spanish tragedy had been a catastrophic decline in the prestige and influence of the League of Nations."
15,1960,IRL,"I should like, on behalf of Ireland, to warn other anti-colonialist countries present here against the propaganda which attempts to represent the United Nations as providing in some way a mask for imperialist intervention."
15,1960,CMR,"In any event, we are pleased to pay a tribute to the prompt intervention by the United Nations in the Congo, action which immediately eliminated any justification for intervention by any foreign force on Congolese national soil."
15,1960,GTM,"Peoples who ever since the beginning of the second quarter of the past century have, with the staunchest possible faith in their destiny, been making great efforts to build up an ordered system of juridical bonds so that they might be able to continue to live together in peace, have now begun to experience intervention in their internal affairs by an extra-continental Power."
15,1960,GTM,"After the First World War, when, with the advent of the totalitarian systems, the conflict of ideologies began, the American peoples kept faith with their traditional principles and unhesitatingly took the side of those who were defending the freedom and dignity of man, so that the threats of intervention by extracontinental Powers were never carried out."
15,1960,GTM,"However, after the Second World War, when the gigantic conflict of ideologies now taking place in the world began to grow more acute, the American people no longer received mere threats of intervention, but were subjected to the effects of a co-ordinated plan of violence and subversion aimed at changing their democratic institutions into a totalitarian, materialistic and atheistic system, a system which attempts to establish dominance not only over nations but also over the innermost thoughts of their citizens."
15,1960,GTM,"If this is not intervention, I should like to ask what is."
15,1960,LUX,"Let me only point out in this connexion that twice within the past thirty-three years the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, its international and national rights attacked and violated while it was naturally powerless to defend itself, has recovered its freedom and independence largely through the disinterested intervention of the United States, thanks to the supreme sacrifice made by thousands of the young men of that country who fought alongside the Allies and who rest, together with one of their most illustrious leaders, in the soil of Luxembourg, soaked as it is with the blood of its American liberators."
15,1960,YUG,"The intervention of the United Nations for the preservation of peace was to have secured for the Congo development along such lines as would have safeguarded its independence, its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and would have been in harmony with the interests of the people of the Congo and the rights of the lawful Government."
15,1960,BGR,"An open and gross intervention in the internal affairs of the Congolese people which has just shaken off the colonial yoke, has been perpetrated; this is a cynical outrage against the free will of the people."
15,1960,IND,"Even in the Assembly, as I had occasion to say in a previous intervention [876th."
15,1960,PRT,Yet the situation in Cabinda is far from that pictured by the letter on which the Foreign Minister based his intervention.
15,1960,CUB,"Who was it that gave that concession to the Moa Bay Company, through the intervention of the United States Ambassador? None other than the tyrannical Government of Fulgencio Batista, the Government that was there to defend the interests of the monopolies, and what is more — and this is a fact beyond any doubt whatever — the concession was completely tax-free."
15,1960,CUB,"There was also intervention in Nicaragua, and for seven years César Augusto Sandino put up a heroic resistance."
15,1960,CUB,"There was intervention more than once in Cuba, and in Haiti and Santo Domingo."
15,1960,CUB,There was intervention in Guatemala.
15,1960,CUB,"Is there any one here who could in honestly deny the intervention of the United Fruit Company and the United States Department of State in the overthrow of the lawful Government of Guatemala? I realize that there are some who consider it their duty as officials to be discreet in this matter and who are capable of coming to this rostrum with a denial, but in their heart of hearts they know that what I say is a fact."
15,1960,CUB,"In view of our anti-colonialist position and our opposition to the exploitation of the under-developed countries, we naturally condemn the form taken by the intervention of the United Nations forces in the Congo."
15,1960,SDN,"We object to any intervention, whether military, political, or in any guise or shape, outside the framework of the United Nations."
15,1960,IRN,"In the Congo, timely United Nations intervention has played a large part in introducing into an exceptionally difficult and threatening situation the stabilizing elements necessary to restore peace and order."
15,1960,LBY,"Some delegations, well-intentioned, certainly, but unfortunately ill-informed as to our tragic and bitter African realities, were convinced by the persistence, not to say the intrigues, of those who loudly proclaimed that any intervention by the United Nations, whatever form it took, would be both ill-timed and dangerous, and that this time France must be given the opportunity to find her own solution for the Algerian conflict."
15,1960,LBY,"The Libyan Government, which severely condemned Belgium’s military intervention in the Congo, considers that it was the ensuing secessionist movements which plunged the new State into the maelstrom of difficulties now besetting it and created serious threats to its unity and territorial integrity."
15,1960,BLR,"The violation of the Soviet Union’s air space by spy aircraft of the United States, the premeditated wrecking by the United States Government of the conference of the Heads of Government of the great Powers in Paris, the intrigues of the colonialists in the Congo (Leopoldville), the threat of intervention against the Republic of Cuba, the sabotaging of the work of the Ten-Nation Committee on Disarmament by the delegations of the Western countries and the plans to equip the West German militarists with nuclear rockets, all testify to the fact that the ruling circles in the United States and in other Western countries have chosen once again to increase international tension."
15,1960,SWE,The first intervention of the Security Council corresponded to a general wish to support the new State.
15,1960,SWE,"An intervention into the internal affairs of the Congo could, from a political point of view, easily lead to a spread of the unrest and to conflicts between States Members of the United Nations."
15,1960,PAK,"The threat of unilateral intervention by the great Powers in the heart of Africa, and the consequent danger to peace in the African continent, has not been removed."
15,1960,GHA,"These incidents, in their turn, provided an occasion for Belgian military intervention."
15,1960,GHA,"The first of these is that the United Nations need not go to the assistance of any country which invites its intervention, but that once it has done so, it owes an obligation to the Government and people of that country not to interfere in such a way as to prevent the legitimate Government which invited it to enter the country from fulfilling its mandate."
15,1960,GHA,"That is why we are anxious that the United Nations, having reached a point where intervention on the side of the legitimate Government of the Congo appears to be the obvious and only answer to this crisis, should act boldly through the medium of the independent African States."
15,1960,GHA,It is impossible to ignore the realities of continued Belgian intervention in the Congo in defiance of the Security Council resolutions.
15,1960,GHA,"Unless such intervention is promptly and effectively checked, and the private armies of all sorts now operating in the Congo are eliminated by the United Nations, there will be no end to the chaos and confusion which now reigns in the new State."
15,1960,RUS,"The courageous Republic of Cuba has become a target for all kinds of attacks, intrigues, subversive activities, economic aggression and, finally, ill disguised threats of intervention."
59,2004,VAT,"This could be brought about by giving organizations like the United Nations special prerogatives to facilitate action to prevent conflicts at times of international crisis, and also, when absolutely necessary, humanitarian intervention — that is, action aimed at disarming the aggressor."
59,2004,MLT,"I would also like, at the outset of my intervention this afternoon, to take the opportunity to express the solidarity of the Maltese people with those countries and people who have suffered loss of life and damage to property as a result of the recent spate of hurricanes and tropical storms, particularly the people of Haiti."
59,2004,NZL,The concept of national sovereignty being paramount and standing in the way of international intervention in local conflicts cannot be sustained.
59,2004,NZL,"As the Secretary- General has challenged us, 'if humanitarian intervention is, indeed, an unacceptable assault on sovereignty, how should we respond to a Rwanda, to a Srebrenica - to gross and systematic violations of human rights that offend every precept of our common humanity?' (A/54/2000, para."
59,2004,NZL,"In the Solomon Islands, the intervention of the Regional Assistance Mission has restored the rule of law by its elected Government in place of the anarchy created by armed militias."
59,2004,CHE,17  A more rapid response does not necessarily mean military intervention.
59,2004,IRL,"I hope, therefore, that the High-level Panel will address the serious questions involved in international intervention, and put forward recommendations that will act as a basis for consensus."
59,2004,DNK,"The High-level Panel's report, a renewed focus on post-conflict intervention, and the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals can herald a new age of strong and effective multilateralism if, collectively, we rise to the challenge."
59,2004,BHS,We regret the failure of the Security Council to act in a timely fashion when Haiti’s friends begged for the authority to intervene or to authorize an intervention.
59,2004,AUS,"The situation in Darfur highlights the need for the international community to develop a better framework for responding to humanitarian crises, and we hope the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change will come up with clear and workable recommendations on humanitarian intervention."
59,2004,AUS,"We have contributed actively to the Panel’s work and we encourage the Panel, in its remaining deliberations, to work towards ambitious recommendations on its entire programme of work, including Security Council reform, addressing threats from WMDs and terrorism, humanitarian intervention and effective collective action."
59,2004,MRT,"We call upon all regional and international actors to support those efforts and to accord to the Sudanese Government the time it needs to honour its commitments without threats of armed intervention, the imposition of sanctions or any tendentious propaganda aimed at giving the Darfur problem an ethnic or sectarian dimension."
59,2004,BOL,"In other words, the participation of the communities and villages where coca is produced in Bolivia should be part of the decision-making process and of the design of strategies to modify current practices of cultivation and to generate reasonable economic options, to open markets, and to reduce the costs of intervention to the international community in the eradication of coca, and in particular in the process of seeking viable alternative ways for the Bolivian economy."
59,2004,LBN,As for the Council's resolution's internal dimension - relating to the amendment of our Constitution - we consider it an unacceptable intervention in our internal affairs.
59,2004,FJI,"However, where there are internal crises and disorder and the United Nations mandates intervention for peace, we are ready to contribute."
59,2004,CAN,"It is considering whether the tragedy qualifies as genocide, because either could provide justification, under international law, for intervention."
59,2004,CAN,"Put simply, there is still no explicit provision in international law for intervention on humanitarian grounds."
59,2004,CAN,It is always preferable to have multilateral authority for intervention in the affairs of a sovereign State.
59,2004,CAN,Thus customary international law is evolving to provide a solid basis in the building of a normative framework for collective humanitarian intervention.
59,2004,CAN,The responsibility to protect is not a license for intervention; it is an international guarantor of political accountability.
59,2004,NRU,The intervention by the Pacific Islands Forum is seen as pre-empting the possibility of the economic crisis escalating into a security and safety issue for the Nauruan people and for the region.
59,2004,SVN,Such cooperation is especially welcome in cases where regional intervention can be more rapid and effective in conflict prevention and in post-conflict peace- building.
59,2004,NGA,"On behalf of the AU, I want to thank the international community for the humanitarian intervention being undertaken."
59,2004,BWA,"In Botswana, our various intervention programmes are beginning to bear fruit."
59,2004,CUB,"We, as non-aligned countries, will have to entrench ourselves in defending the United Nations Charter, because if we do not it will be redrafted with the deletion of every trace of such principles as the sovereign equality of States, non-intervention and the non-use or the threat of use of force."
59,2004,GNQ,That campaign has as its only objective the justification of an absurd intervention by force in Equatorial Guinea — the failed multinational mercenary invasion that was to have taken place on 6 March last.
59,2004,NER,The restored status of the State has made it possible — thanks to the personal intervention of President Tandja Mamadou — to quickly overcome the resistance of the remaining few who were still opposed to the expanded polio vaccination programme.

01,1946,CUB,"It is our conviction, and allow me to put the greatest emphasis on these words, that no true Spaniard will ever resent as an intervention in the internal affairs of his country, any action on the part of the Spanish-American nations intended to assure the happiness and the peace of the Spanish people."
01,1946,MEX,"How can we do that? By strengthening the United Nations Organization, by ensuring that it does not fall into discredit, and by preventing its work from being limited to registering events of world importance which take place without its intervention."

01,1946,BEL,"Among the matters in regard to which the veto rules have paralyzed the action of the Security Council, there is one which has called for the intervention of the Belgian Government, and which I should like, for this reason, to mention especially."
01,1946,VEN,"Forgive me if I continue to abuse your patience, but I cannot conclude our intervention in the general discussion without dwelling on another factor which is disturbing the smooth working of the United Nations, and is helping to prolong the uneasiness which is felt with regard to the possibilities of success."
01,1946,CHL,"Well now, I think that the best way of defending the principle of non-intervention would be precisely to endeavour to eliminate any dictatorial regime of government established by fascist intervention in a specific State."
01,1946,CHL,It does not matter whether the Powers which intervened have disappeared in the fray: the important thing is to demolish the structure which they set up through their intervention.
01,1946,CHL,"In other cases, where the regimes are simply anti-democratic, the principle of non-intervention, particularly in America, should be reserved as an instrument of action against such regimes if they claim in any way to intervene in their turn in the domestic or foreign affairs of other countries."
17,1962,ZAF,"and non-intervention in each other's internal affairs""."
17,1962,ALB,Another source of persistent tension and danger in the Far East is the foreign intervention in South Korea and South Viet-Nam.
17,1962,ALB,"The United States has carried out military intervention there and is conducting an ""undeclared war"" against the local population."
17,1962,ALB,It condemns foreign intervention and calls for the withdrawal of the United States troops from the country.
17,1962,ROU,"In South Viet-Nam, the United States has engaged in direct military intervention in order to crush the people's resistance to a corrupt regime which remains in power thanks only to United States military support."
17,1962,BLR,"Our delegation, like other delegations, has received a note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam, addressed to the President of the seventeenth session of the General Assembly, in which attention is drawn to the dangerous situation that has arisen as a result of United States military intervention in South."
17,1962,COG,"Unfortunately, however, other local hotbeds of war continue to threaten the stability' of East Asia, South Viet-Nam and South Korea are the victims of foreign infiltration which in its turn justifies further intervention."
17,1962,COG,"I shall not recall the differences of opinion in this Assembly about the various external interventions in the southern part of the Congo, including the intervention of our own Organization."
17,1962,MAR,"However, those happy results must not make us forget that today there are still countries struggling for independence, sovereignty and unity and that others are waging the same struggle to prevent foreign intervention in their affairs."
17,1962,COL,"The concept of non-intervention — a principle laid down in the Charter of the United Nations, and taken up and stressed by the Organization of American States in its own Charter — has also been distorted or set at naught, primarily through subterfuges whereby interventionist forces seek to lay hold upon Governments in order to subjugate their peoples, craftily avoiding a frontal attack so as to avoid bringing into play the machinery for collective security and for defence of the true principle of nonintervention."
17,1962,COL,"Colombia has always upheld the principle of non-intervention, but for us this principle does not imply an attitude of indifference of tolerance towards those who violate it."
17,1962,COL,"It is quite natural that in attending this world gathering Colombia hopes that the boundary between truth and error may be clearly marked out, that a true order of ideas and a genuine sense of values may be restored, and that there may be no more false invoking of principles which a nihilistic philosophy seeks to rob of their high moral sense: order without justice, coexistence without freedom, social harmony through the class struggle, law used for the a posteriori sanctioning of abuse, free self- determination solely for the purpose of changing masters, non-intervention as a safeguard for those who have committed intervention, anti-colonialism for those who have shown their eagerness to colonize, pacifism behind which lurks aggression, neutrality for those who are already prepared to take sides and to become satellites."
17,1962,BOL,"It is because we waged a long struggle to possess our own country that we resolutely support the principle of self-determination, and it is because we recognize the right of all other peoples to do likewise that we resolutely defend the principle of non-intervention, 163."
17,1962,BOL,"At the root of the principles of self-determination and non-intervention lies, we believe, the will of the common man."
17,1962,BOL,"Disregard for the principles of self-determination and non-intervention has brought about a dramatic and artificial situation in which we find peoples that are denied the possibility of expressing their wishes, countries that are involuntary fields of battle between other countries, nations that are occupied and nations that are divided."
17,1962,IRQ,"The struggle against colonial domination and intervention is consuming most of the energies of the people, thereby retarding their economic and social development, which is the most fundamental aspiration of people everywhere."
17,1962,IRQ,This type of intervention falls in the pattern of the traditional colonial policy of divide and rule.
17,1962,IRQ,"To meet these new trends, the colonial Powers have resorted, on the one hand, to augmenting their military preparedness, and, on the other, to increasing their direct and indirect intervention in the affairs of the countries which submit to their military and political influence."
17,1962,IRQ,"Last but not least, the West is using Israel as a cover for its policy of intervention in the Middle East, Africa and Asia."
17,1962,IRQ,"In certain cases, the method of partition was employed as in the case of Palestine; in others the form of government was chosen under pressure and intervention by the colonialists."
17,1962,IRQ,"For example, in a number of oases the Governments which emerged out of this intervention Were of a reactionary or feudal character."
17,1962,POL,"What do we see at the present time? We see the efforts to solve the majority of the most important international problems meeting with resistance; the unceasing West-German provocations in Berlin; a serious situation further deteriorating in South Viet-Nam because of the open and continuous intervention of United States troops; the situation in the Congo; the situation in South Korea; the resumption of activity by the notorious spy aircraft over the territories of various States; and, lastly, the extremely dangerous policy of intervention conducted by the United States against Cuba."
17,1962,SDN,"It is high time that the mandate given by the United Nations be immediately implemented to relieve the whole world, and the Congolese in particular, of this agony, and to end a secession which is beyond doubt sustained by foreign intervention and vested interests."
17,1962,RUS,"We may ask: Where are the obligations; solemnly assumed by the United States of America under the United Nations Charter, which provide for non-intervention by States in each other's domestic affairs? Are we to believe that when the United States delegation, which sat at the same table with us at the Conference of States founders of the United Nations in 1945, affixed its signature to the Charter in the name of the United States of America, that was nothing but an empty farce? In those days, after all, the leaders of the United States Government assured us that the United States of America took seriously the obligations it was assuming, under the United Nations Charter."
17,1962,RUS,"This is indeed to undermine the one foundation upon which the United Nations can rest: non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States, and respect for their institutions and way of life."
17,1962,RUS,"Respect for the sovereign rights of every State, renunciation of all intervention in the domestic affairs of other States, recognition of the right of Governments to establish the social and political system corresponding to the interests and wishes of their people —such must be the fixed and infrangible rules of contemporary international life."
17,1962,HUN,Under the shadow of these dangers I am going to select some of the actual political problems of peaceful coexistence as the main subject-matter of my intervention.
17,1962,HUN,"The Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union rightly stated in his intervention in the general debate [1127th meeting] that: ""."
17,1962,HUN,"The Permanent Representative of the United States, after the intervention of the Soviet delegation in this general debate, came out with these words; ""The sober seventeenth session has ended on the fourth day."
17,1962,HUN,And what happened? Even the American Press made it clear that the United States agreed to the neutrality of Laos in order to free its military strength for further intervention in South Viet-Nam.
17,1962,HUN,"In the present circumstances, projects of invasion, murder, killing and assassination, possibilities of direct military intervention, formation of special contingents of Cuban citizens in the United States Army and reprisals against countries maintaining trade relations with the valiant people of Cuba are everyday topics of all sorts of official declarations."
17,1962,ARE,"We trust that such concern will eventually prove to have been unwarranted and that the principle of non-intervention by any country, whichever country it may be, in any other country's internal affairs will be steadily and soberly honoured and respected by all concerned."
17,1962,ARE,Recent developments in Yemen also call for a similar reminder that there should be no foreign intervention whatsoever by any country in Yemen's internal affairs.
17,1962,ARE,"They show further that foreign imperialist intervention is still very active in the Congo, as is co-operation and support for secessionist Katanga in defiance of United Nations resolutions upholding the real independence and integrity of the Congo."
17,1962,ARE,"The responsibility for all this should be laid at the door of the countries which, by their direct or indirect intervention, are to blame."
17,1962,SYR,"Needless to say, coexistence lies at the basis of non-intervention."
17,1962,SYR,"Owing to the circumstances which I have recalled, Syria's geographical position and the essentially democratic and pan-Arab aspirations of its people, the latter has had to carry on a relentless struggle against all foreign intervention in its affairs."
17,1962,SYR,We seek to preserve our national independence by protecting it from all outside intervention.
17,1962,THA,"In point of fact, even now there are instances in which Governments proclaim their aversion to war and their longing for peace, but at the same time there are assertions of support for what is called wars of national liberation — which to all practical intents and purposes, means that interference and even intervention will be condoned in national societies which may have dissident elements within their own internal structures."
17,1962,THA,"Political support, as well as men and ""materiel"", would flow into the area of conflict; and if that was still not enough, threats of intervention or even open warfare might be brought into action."
17,1962,BRA,The principle of non-intervention derives from this.
17,1962,BRA,Non-intervention and self-determination are not mutually exclusive but rather complementary.
17,1962,TUN,"The latest news to reach the United Nations brings fresh evidence of foreign intervention: it reveals that the Katangese ""gendarmerie"" is still officered by European mercenaries and that supplies of arms, including fighter aircraft, are still reaching Katanga, contrary to the Security Council resolution of 21 February 1961."
17,1962,SLV,"It holds the principles of self-determination and non-intervention to be the necessary basis for peaceful coexistence among States, but for that very reason it defends its democratic creed and resolutely opposes any kind of totalitarianism, whether of the right or of the left, which some may seek to impose upon it."
17,1962,LAO,"Those agreements, by putting an end to foreign intervention in all its forms, marked the achievement of national reconciliation."
17,1962,LAO,It is a question of completely extinguishing them by putting an immediate end to foreign intervention.
17,1962,URY,"Such would be, for instance, respect for self-determination; the principle of non-intervention, strict observance of which would be a very effective, if not the most effective way of restoring confidence between nations; the principle of self-defence, and genuine, equality before the law; freedom of communication and trade between all the peoples of the world; and finally, the duty, of the rich nations to come to the help of the poorer nations, not in pursuance of an optional unilateral decision, but in compliance with a regular legal and natural obligation."
17,1962,HTI,"Respect for the principles of non-intervention and self-determination of peoples, the shield of the political Independence of weak nations, remains the firm basis of my country's foreign policy."
17,1962,YUG,"The Yugoslav Government has always abided by and carried out the principles of non-intervention and self-determination, and it is its firm desire that these principles should become guiding principles in the policies of all Governments, it is in this light that serious problems like that of Cuba and others can and should be settled."
17,1962,MNG,The war hysteria against revolutionary Cuba that is now gathering strength in the United States and the outrageous demands made by certain reckless elements for direct military intervention against Cuba are fraught with the gravest dangers to the cause of peace.
17,1962,DOM,"Parallel with these concepts, there has also developed, as an intrinsic part of the system, the principle of non-intervention, which has been of inestimable value in promoting inter-American relations and has been the staunch defence of the weaker nations against the stronger."
17,1962,DOM,"We are sure, however, that though the principle of non-intervention has not yet taken final shape it will eventually be defined in harmony with the new concept of the inter-dependence of States engaged in a common undertaking."
17,1962,DOM,"Against this background the Eighth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, at Punta del Este adopted resolution VI, which reads as follows: ""Whereas: ""The inter-American system is based on consistent adherence by its constituent States to certain objectives and principles of solidarity, set forth in the instruments that govern it; ""Among these objectives and principles are those of respect for the freedom of man and preservation of his rights, the full exercise of representative democracy, non-intervention of one State in the internal or external affairs of another, and rejection of alliances and agreements that may lead to intervention in America by extra-continental Powers; ""The Seventh Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, held in San José, Costa Rica, condemned the intervention or the threat of intervention of extra-continental communist Powers in the hemisphere and reiterated the obligation of the American States to observe faithfully the principles of the regional organization; ""The present Government of Cuba has identified itself with the principles of Marxist-Leninist ideology, has established apolitical, economic, and social system based on that doctrine, and accepts military assistance from extra-continental communist Powers, including even the threat of military intervention in America on the part of the Soviet Union; ""The Report of the Inter-American Peace Committee to the Eighth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs establishes that: ‘The present connexions of the Government of Cuba with the Sino-Soviet bloc of countries are evidently incompatible with the principles and standards that govern the regional system, and particularly with the collective security established by the Charter of the Organization of American States and the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance’; ""The above-mentioned Report of the Inter-American Peace Committee also states that: ‘It is evident that the ties of the Cuban Government with the Sino- Soviet bloc will prevent the said Government from fulfilling the obligations stipulated in the Charter of the Organization and the Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance’; ""Such a situation in an American State violates, the obligations inherent in membership in the regional system and is incompatible with that system; ""The attitude adopted by the present Government of Cuba and its acceptance of military assistance offered by extra-continental communist Powers breaks down the effective defence of the inter-American system; and ""No member state of the inter-American system can claim the rights; and privileges pertaining thereto if it denies or fails to recognize the corresponding obligation, ""Declares: ""1."
17,1962,DOM,"""During the meeting it was manifest that at the present juncture the most urgent of these problems, is the Sino-Soviet intervention in Cuba as an attempt to convert the island into an armed base for communist penetration of the Americas and subversion of the democratic institutions of the Hemisphere."
17,1962,DOM,"""The meeting reiterated its adherence to the principles of self-determination, non-intervention and democracy as guiding standards of relations among the American nations."
17,1962,DOM,Military intervention of communist powers in Cuba cannot be justified as a situation analogous to the defensive measures adopted in other parts of the Free World in order to face Soviet imperialism.
17,1962,DOM,"""The meeting recalled that the Soviet Union's intervention in Cuba threatens the unity of the Americas and of its democratic institutions, and that this intervention has special characteristics which; pursuant to paragraph 3 of Resolution II of the Eighth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, call for the adoption of special measures, both individual and collective."
17,1962,CAF,"In those circumstances, my country cannot but endorse and support the United Nations intervention in the Congo, and it fully shares the Secretary-General's anxieties regarding the difficulties he has in meeting the costs of this operation."
17,1962,MEX,"Each of us, spokesmen for our Governments and peoples, has proclaimed in this forum his determination to pursue social justice in peace and freedom; each has affirmed the supremacy of right over might; each has spoken out for the peaceful settlement of disputes, respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights, the self-determination of peoples, non-intervention in domestic affairs, and international cooperation to raise levels of living and to combat the poverty, disease and ignorance which still afflict man in every region of this planet."
17,1962,CUB,"We wish to lend our full support, together with other nations which, have been heard in this hall, to promote a most rapid implementation of the Declarations on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples [General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)] because we in particular have seen what foreign military intervention means; the withdrawal of foreign troops… 10."
17,1962,CUB,"We are also aware that, at the meeting of foreign ministers and elsewhere, respectable representatives of Latin American countries, despite their ideological differences with our revolution, have defended the principles of non-intervention and national self-determination."
17,1962,CUB,"We have indeed more than once asserted our right to recover this territory, which was taken from us by coercion and force on the occasion of intervention by the United States."
17,1962,CUB,"We have repeatedly proclaimed, and we do so again, our respect for the principle of non-intervention, for the sovereignty and for the independence of all the other American countries."
17,1962,CUB,"The Revolutionary Government of Cuba, as was stated in the decision of its Council of Ministers, affirms once more that the foreign policy of our country is founded on the principle of non-intervention, on the right of all nations to self-determination, on recognition of the sovereign equality of States, on freedom of trade, on the settlement of international disputes by negotiation and on the will to co-exist in peace with all the peoples of the world."
17,1962,CUB,"Faithful as it is to these tenets of its international policy and to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, Cuba does not constitute the slightest threat to the security of any country in our continent, It has never displayed, nor does it now display, any, aggressive intentions towards any of them; but rather the most absolute respect for the policy of non-intervention being convinced, as our own national history goes, to show, that every people has the sovereign right to shape its own destinies without any odious interference from outside."
17,1962,KHM,"Nevertheless, we think that direct foreign intervention, openly recognized and proclaimed, is not likely to bring about a settlement of this conflict, which we fear may spread."
17,1962,BGR,"The reality is that after the military intervention in Cuba in 1961 the Government of that country decided to organize the armed forces needed to deal with possible new acts of aggression, with which the Cuban people are being daily threatened by the United States and particularly by certain influential circles in that country."
17,1962,BGR,"These preparations and this direct intervention are nevertheless continuing, are becoming more and more pressing and are taking on an official character."
17,1962,BGR,It prepares the ground opens the way for direct armed intervention in the Republic of Cuba.
17,1962,BGR,"To combat the ideas of national and social liberation by force of arms is to want to transform ideological arguments and controversy — which are bound to exist in the developing present-day world — into military aggression and armed intervention against peoples and States, and to turn ideological struggles and debates about the advantages of one regime or another into armed conflict between States."
17,1962,BGR,"There also exists a very large number of non-aligned countries which oppose with all their moral and material strength any infringement of national independence and sovereignty, any intervention in the internal affairs of States, which the imperialist countries would like to make once more the prevailing rule in international relations."
17,1962,BGR,"A United States High Command has been established at Saigon itself for the purpose of organizing a campaign of intervention, not only against the Viet-Namese people, but also against the other peoples of the region."
17,1962,USA,"In Laos, civil war, abetted by foreign intervention, has been replaced by a cease-fire and an independent government under international guarantees."
17,1962,ARG,"If we return to the positive principles which it enshrines, we shall have achieved a basis of mutual consideration and understanding, When all States respect the rights of neighbouring States, not only in word but in deed, and faithfully comply with the international obligations they have undertaken, when all States recognize the legal equality of other States, when the principle of non-intervention becomes a reality, we shall have reached the stage of education without which an international legal order and world peace — our supreme objective — cannot be achieved."
17,1962,ARG,"The principle of non-intervention — which my country has proclaimed, supported and applied as one of the guiding principles of its international policy — must be accompanied by proper respect for every country’s right freely to choose its own institutions."
17,1962,ARG,"No country can demand respect in its right to self-determination if at the same time, by well-organized propaganda, it is attacking other peoples and violating the principle of non-intervention."
17,1962,ARG,"In its international policy our country scrupulously respects the principles of self- determination and non-intervention, but it demands reciprocity."
17,1962,AUS,"The United Nations took action to prevent the Congo from becoming the scene of armed clash and outside intervention by foreign Powers, and to prevent the disturbances there from spreading into a wider conflict."
17,1962,PAN,"Two of those principles are also basic to the San Francisco Charter: namely, those of the self-determination of peoples and of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of another State."
17,1962,PAN,"With regard to the principle of non-intervention, this can only refer to unilateral or individual intervention by one State in the internal affairs of another State because collective interventions are contemplated and expressly regulated in both the United Nations Charter ""and the Inter-American-Treaty of Reciprocal-Assistance."
17,1962,PAN,"The Latin-American concept of non-intervention is directed not only against armed intervention but also against any form of foreign intervention inside the frontiers of another State whether it is of an economic, ideological, doctrinal, political or other character."
17,1962,PAN,"All the inter-American States have committed themselves to defend, their regional system against any act or intervention from within or outside the continent which might undermine, weaken, subvert or destroy that political system."
17,1962,PER,"The oriels was resolved as a result of the intervention of the armed forces, which, in an institutional development without precedent in our history, set up a government providing for the full exercise of civic rights solely with a view, to the holding of genuinely free elections as provided in the Constitution."
17,1962,PER,"The principle of respect for the domestic jurisdiction of States, which is laid down in the Charter and which, in the form of the principle of non-intervention, has marked features of its own in our American system, can certainly be invoked by the regional systems against anyone attempting to bring to their shores ideologies which they reject or to discuss situations which they alone are competent to deal with."
17,1962,PER,"This same principle of non-intervention is fully valid in regard to direct, relations among States."
17,1962,CYP,It cannot be denied that United Nations intervention has overcome many international crises and prevented war.
17,1962,UKR,"Is there any need to stress that what is in process here is the expansion of United States armed intervention in this region, carefully planned and organized in the Pentagon? But, if we follow Mr."
17,1962,SLE,"Since we believe that there is universal agreement amongst us that each Member State has the sovereign right to choose its own form of government, we urge both the United States Government and the Soviet Union to refrain from interfering in Cuba's internal affairs and from armed intervention over Cuba."
16,1961,IRQ,"Despite ail these endeavours of the imperialist Powers to adapt their policy to changing circumstances, the old and traditional colonial system still manifests itself in the war in Algeria, the intervention in the Congo, the policy of integration as practised by Portugal, the racial discrimination in South Africa, the police regimes in some United Kingdom territories in Africa, the gun-boat policy carried on by the United Kingdom in the Arabian Gulf and Southern Arabian Peninsula."
16,1961,IRQ,""" Subsequent events and developments both in France and Algeria show that neither party has changed its position; the Algerian people are more determined than ever to achieve their independence in an integral Algeria, while the French monopolies are increasingly enlisting the support of their counterparts in the West, and particularly in the United States, and having the protection and intervention of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]."
16,1961,POL,"Blind anti- communism, colonialist interests, the desire to dominate, interest connected with armaments, all these factors operate in favour of the arms race, tension, the cold war, the policy of risk, intervention and local wars and, consequently, in favour of a worldwide atomic conflagration."
16,1961,CUB,"This circumstance, however, does not dismay or disturb Cuba in the exercise of its rights and duties as a country which bases its concept of international relations on respect for the right of peoples to self-determination, the full enjoyment of sovereignty, the principle of non-intervention, the sovereign equality of States and their peaceful coexistence whatever their political and social systems."
16,1961,CUB,The repeated and well-grounded accusations and claims which Cuba has made in the Security Council and in the General Assembly have been provoked by the wilful acts of aggression and intervention by the United States Government in its internal affairs.
16,1961,CUB,"The shameless allegations, oblique references and appeals for surrender which we have heard from certain specific speakers or have read in the Press— including statements by two Presidents of Latin American Republics, one abjuring the principle of non-intervention and the other offering his adherence to the ""free world"" in exchange for his preservation in power—are in conformity with the strategy and tactics of the United States Government."
16,1961,CUB,"Alfonso Arino de Melho Franco, the distinguished former Foreign Minister and present representative of Brazil, stated the position of the genuinely representative Governments of Latin America towards the Cuban revolution plainly and unequivocally: ""Respect for sovereignty, based on the principle of non-intervention""—I am quoting literally—""constitutes an imperative duty of international life and an essential condition for the restoration of continental harmony."
16,1961,CUB,"On the occasion of the announcement of a forthcoming intervention by the Organization of American State in the affairs of our country, Dr."
16,1961,ETH,But enough is known to demand our immediate intervention and to elicit our universal condemnation.
16,1961,LBR,"This intervention has been the source of Attacks on the Secretary-General, on the Secretariat and on the Organization itself."
16,1961,LBR,"On balance, however, the United Nations intervention did make a significant and valuable contribution to the solution of the problem in the Congo."
16,1961,IND,"It fought the Japanese in the great war, then the French colonialists, then the inhabitants have fought amongst themselves, with foreign intervention as the main promoting factor."
16,1961,IND,"The Assembly has, time after time, asked for the withdrawal of those non-Congolese who are not in the country by permission of the Congolese Government, or through the United Nations, but the position of foreign intervention of this kind still continues."
16,1961,GBR,I remind the Assembly that the reason for the original intervention of the United Nations in the Congo was to prevent external interference designed to exploit conditions of civil war.
16,1961,GBR,"At this time last year, the Assembly judged overwhelmingly that such external intervention must be stopped for, if it was not stopped, it would bring the independent life of a united Congo to an -2nd."
16,1961,GBR,"Is each country in the Assembly willing to stand up and say that it will pay its share, and are all nations ready to face the consequences of United Nations intervention in a particular matter on the vote of a majority? 107."
16,1961,RUS,"Is not this in line with the principles and high purposes to which the States Members of the United Nations subscribed in signing the Organization's Charter? And is it not a crime to organize against Cuba — whose people wishes to build its own State in independence-subversive activities, an economic blockade,' and armed intervention? 173."
16,1961,RUS,The General Assembly cannot overlook the fact that those who organized the recent intervention are hatching fresh criminal plots against the Cuban people.
16,1961,BRA,"It continues to maintain that respect for sovereignty, based on the principle of non-intervention, is a compelling obligation in international life and an essential condition for the restoration of continental harmony."
16,1961,NGA,This is my first intervention in the general debate of the Assembly as the Foreign Minister and the Minister of Commonwealth Relations of Nigeria.
16,1961,NGA,I sincerely hope that the external intervention in the Congo will stop.
16,1961,NGA,"We have found that, without the intervention of the United Nations, there would have been a conflagration in the Congo which would have led to a third world war if the big Powers had been allowed to continue their struggle there."
16,1961,NGA,"And so, by the intervention of the smaller States through the Organization, we may bring sanity in the midst of insanity and save humanity from total destruction."
16,1961,GAB,Too often this division has been encouraged by the intervention of certain Powers.
16,1961,BGR,"Military intervention has been undertaken against free Cuba-intervention that was organized and financed by the United States, and conducted from its territory."
16,1961,BGR,"It was then that intervention was organized against a socialist State and it 'did not suit the interventionists when the Soviet communists, whose programme had in fact hitherto called for the disbandment of the regular army, created the Red Army and defeated their enemies."
16,1961,IDN,"it is the duty of the world community to continue to do everything ill its power in order to erase the consequences and to prevent any further foreign intervention in this young African State, and to enable the Congo to embark freely upon the road of its independent development based on respect for its sovereignty, unity and its territorial integrity""."
16,1961,IDN,"He even suggested, on behalf of the Netherlands Government, that the Assembly, the United Nations, now intervene and lend its hand to solve the problem—an intervention that the Netherlands Government has so far opposed."
16,1961,IDN,"van Roijen, to the United Nations Security Council at the end of 1948, when the question of Indonesia's independence was settled through the intervention of the United Nations."
16,1961,IDN,"""If not based upon this assumption, any intervention of the United Nations may only make the problem more acute and explosive."
16,1961,SDN,"Foreign intervention, overt or covert, from which the Congolese people have suffered so grievously during the past year, should not be repeated."
16,1961,BOL,"Thus we advocate and shall continue to advocate respect for the principle of non-intervention in matters which are within the sovereign jurisdiction of States, because to do otherwise would amount to challenging the independence of peoples."
16,1961,SOM,The question of unwarranted intervention in the internal affairs of other States deserves our consideration at this meeting.
16,1961,SOM,"Such intervention is regrettable and is an additional source of international tension, as was observed in the Congo crisis and in other similarly serious situations."
16,1961,SOM,I sincerely hope that everything possible will be done to prevent such unwarranted intervention in the internal affairs of other countries.
16,1961,SOM,"While on this subject, may I point out that it would be most unfortunate and inequitable if the legitimate territorial claims of a State were to be interpreted as unwarranted intervention and were disapproved of on that ground."
16,1961,LAO,"In the past, the intervention of the United Nations has helped to prevent the spread of conflicts which, without it, might have led to a world war."
16,1961,LAO,To emit countless threats of intervention at all sensitive nerve centres in the world is no true way of finding peace.
16,1961,LAO,"The intervention of Viet-Minh in Laos has been an established fact, known to all, for a long time."
16,1961,LAO,"What more does the Laotian peoples want? It wants all forms of intervention to come to an end, that the const."
16,1961,HND,"This, however, is only the beginning of a long road the end of which is the intervention of science hi the final settlement of human disputes."
16,1961,CHL,Our mutual relations must be based on the full compliance with the principle of non-intervention in the internal or external affairs of States.
16,1961,DOM,"I am not denying that that action, in violation of the principle of non-intervention, the bulwark of inter- American relations, and that censurable deed which almost cost the life of one of the leaders of hemispheric democracy, deserved to be punished."
16,1961,DOM,"But there were no censure or sanctions against the other country, ruled by a leftist dictatorship in which the interest of a foreign Power takes precedence over true interests of the American continent, because such measures were deemed incompatible with the principle of non-intervention and respect for national sovereignty."
16,1961,ARG,"Invariably, with exemplary consistency, Argentina's international policy has been based on the three fundamental principles of international life — the legal equality of States, non-intervention in domestic affairs, and the self-determination of peoples."
16,1961,ARG,"We have opposed foreign intervention and any kind of pressure, whether political, economic, legal or ideological, by one nation upon another."
16,1961,ARG,"The Argentine Republic is a member of the Organization of American States, and confirms its most resolute adherence to the high principles of Pan-Americanism, which have preserved the indestructible cohesion and solidarity of the American family of nations on the basis of respect for individual sovereignty and for the principle of self-determination and non-intervention."
16,1961,KHM,"Thus we have noted, in the most responsible newspapers and from the pens of the most objective of journalists, observations of this sort: ""The Belgrade Conference endeavoured to confer upon those taking part in it a kind of mandate to act as arbiters of world policy""; ""Twenty-four nations are trying to form a consortium for intervention in world affairs."
16,1961,KHM,"The ideal solution would undoubtedly be that each of these peoples should be reunified through a general referendum organized and supervised by the United Nations, without intervention from the Government of either part of the divided country, since each such Government is aligned with one of the blocs originally responsible for the division."
16,1961,KHM,"I then suggested intervention by the United Nations, acceptance of its arbitration, and supervision of the referendum on self- determination—which seemed to me to be the only logical way of achieving an unchallengeable result."
16,1961,KHM,"The Algerian representatives—who are present in this very hall as observers—at once accepted this suggestion, but France took the view that it was a French domestic affair and that, in those circumstances, United Nations intervention could not be accepted."
16,1961,URY,"Secondly, as a logical corollary — since after all this is no more than a means for the effective exercise of self-determination — my country once again reaffirms from this high rostrum the principle of non-intervention, which is the keystone of the Charter  and of our anti-American system, and a safeguard of the sovereignty and Integrity of peoples."
16,1961,COL,"Similarly, in the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance of Rio de Janeiro, we undertook to repel extra-continental or intra-continental intervention directed against any American State, and to consider an attack against an American state as an act of aggression against all the American States."
16,1961,COL,"The principle of non-intervention is common to the American Organization and the United Nations, and the peace and security of nations are dependent on the faithful observance of this principle."
16,1961,COL,"* to ensure that this international precept may not be violated with dangerous impunity, my country considers it essential that the appropriate organs of the system 'should define all the acts of intervention which constitute aggression."
16,1961,COL,We cannot accept a unilateral interpretation of the principle of non-intervention.
16,1961,GTM,"My country is not, however, the only one that has suffered from this foreign intervention; others, too, have been invaded by mercenaries and by intensive communist propaganda, and for these reasons —  and others too numerous to mention — we have been obliged to break off diplomatic relations with that Caribbean country."
16,1961,GTM,Respect for the principle of non-intervention has been forgotten.
16,1961,GTM,"It also hopes that our Organization will continue to struggle, as in the past, against aggression, intervention, the abuse of power, economic exploitation, poverty and ignorance, and to fight for the integrity and independence of nations, for the legal equality of States and their peaceful coexistence, for freedom and the full observance of human rights, as well as for the material and spiritual progress of all peoples."
16,1961,GTM,"As is well-known to this Organization, Guatemala continues to be affected by another kind of intervention by one of the most civilized of nations which, contrary to reason and right and the most elementary principles of justice and equity that are essential for intercourse among nations, has persisted in retaining part of Guatemala's national territory, which by history and law belongs to it, thus impeding development of one of the country's richest areas and impairing the vital interests of the nation."
16,1961,BLR,France's seven- year war against the freedom-loving people of Algeria; the bloody retribution meted out by Portugal to the local inhabitants of Angola; the tragic events in South West Africa; the intervention of the colonialists in the infernal affairs of the Congo; the United States aggression against Cuba; the intervention of the SEATO countries in the internal affairs of Laos; the aggression by France against Tunisia—all go to show that the colonialists are trying in every way and by every means to maintain their colonial domination.
16,1961,BLR,"In order to protect the Congolese people from further crimes, all forms of colonialist intervention in the affairs of the Republic of the Congo must be brought to an end."
16,1961,COD,"We venture to hope that the Secretary-General did not sacrifice his life in vain, and that Mr, Tshomb6 now understands the true reasons for the United Nations intervention in the Congo."
16,1961,COD,"Thanks to the United Nations intervention, however, the Congo survived."
16,1961,VEN,The principle of non-intervention in the affairs of other Governments has been zealously and consistently applied by Venezuela.
16,1961,VEN,"In conformity with this principle of non-intervention, Venezuela condemns the attempts of certain Governments, acting in collusion with disaffected political groups which serve as their fifth column for propaganda and for stirring up violence, to upset law and order and seek to change by force the political structure of other countries."
16,1961,ECU,"They are: non-intervention, self-determination of peoples and legal equality of States."
16,1961,ECU,"The principle of ""non-intervention"" is the embodiment of the respect due by States to one another, whereby each State is allowed to take the political course it desires and to adopt whatever socio-political structure it may wish, without feeling itself threatened by the intervention of others in matters which are its own concern."
16,1961,ECU,"The annunciation, consecration, and defence of this right of ""non-intervention"" have cost America enough bloodshed, suffering* and delays in the continent's political development."
16,1961,ECU,"I may assure the General Assembly on behalf of my delegation that Ecuador has been one of the most ardent defenders of the principle of non-intervention, from the time when that principle first saw the light as a mere proposition or postulate, to the present, its justification is self-evident and, as a solid and unalterable foundation of the American continental structure, it cannot be ignored, unless we wish to undermine the very existence of our American juridical and social system."
16,1961,ECU,"Its zeal has been such that in signing the Additional Protocol relative to non-intervention, adopted at the Inter-American Conference for the Maintenance Of Peace held at Buenos Aires in 1936, it explained that it adopted the Additional Protocol ""in all cases and without reservation, but with the understanding that the procedure of consultation provided for by the Convention for the Maintenance, Preservation and Re-establishment of Peace shall not be considered as direct nor as indirect intervention""."
16,1961,MLI,"It is an incontrovertible fact that the result of our Organization's intervention in the Congo is far from doing us credit, for it is difficult to show that United Nations officers were not implicated in the murder of Prime Minister Lumumba."
16,1961,LKA,"It has sometimes meant intervention — I am sorry to have to say it, but it has — in the internal affairs of those countries."
16,1961,LKA,The basic principle in the relations of the great Powers to these countries must be non-intervention and non-interference in internal affairs.
22,1967,VEN,"This principle, together with that of non-intervention, constitutes the basis of coexistence among nations."
22,1967,TTO,I say to the representatives of the Government of Cuba: unwarranted intervention in the affairs of other States cannot but Justify intervention in your own.
22,1967,GTM,I cannot complete any comments on the political items without referring briefly to aggression and intervention as phenomena which are troubling these and other regions of the world.
22,1967,GTM,"Despite the fact that the specialists in legal and political philosophy have gone deeply into conceptual elements that might become a source of concern if brought face to face with political realities or prospects, Guatemala feels that a limited definition is feasible, provided that it is supplemented by the principle of non-intervention, which is the keystone of our foreign policy and of the concept of coexistence embodied in the United Nations Charter."
22,1967,GTM,"We, who are the first to proclaim and observe the principle of non-intervention and the right of peoples to decide their own destiny, wish also to be the first to recognize that the only form of international coexistence is that embodied in the United Nations Charter, which is based on mutual respect."
22,1967,SDN,"The people of Viet-Nam, which fought so heroically against colonialism, is certainly capable of shaping its own destiny; it should be allowed to do so without foreign intervention."
22,1967,ZMB,"Let it be known that with the South African military intervention, and Portugal's continued assistance, in support of the rebels, the British Government cannot come out of Rhodesia with peace and honour."
22,1967,ZMB,"That Britain should merely protest to South Africa against military intervention in its colony, while at the same time condemning the freedom fighters, is the story of the year; that the Vorster regime has told Britain in no uncertain terms that South Africa will act anywhere where it is allowed to do so and that it will not have Britain dictate to it over its security forces in Rhodesia, which will remain there for as long as necessary, and that Britain has done nothing to have them physically removed, all amounts to abdication by Britain from the discharge of its responsibility for four million people in Rhodesia."
22,1967,ZMB,Its military intervention in Rhodesia against Africans is especially dangerous and is a challenge to Africa and to the United Nations.
22,1967,TZA,"Responsibility for the present danger, and for the present sufferings of the Viet-Namese people, lies squarely upon the shoulders of all those who are continuing their active intervention in the affairs of this South-East Asian nation."
22,1967,BGR,"This war is a flagrant violation of the principles of self-determination, of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of States, and of the freedom of every people to govern itself and determine its own social order."
22,1967,BGR,These threats are aimed at preventing the development of the Cuban people along progressive lines and at creating an atmosphere of permanent tension and insecurity in the area in order to justify future intervention in the domestic affairs of the Cuban Republic.
22,1967,SEN,But self-determination manifestly means cessation of all foreign intervention.
22,1967,MWI,"After all, South Africa is not the only country In the world that has adopted in the conduct of its affairs a philosophy which others do not like; some of us assembled here do not like the philosophy of communism which has been adopted by many Member countries In the conduct of their domestic affairs; others of us do not like the philosophy of capitalism upon which others have equally based the conduct of their domestic affairs, but we do not seek to put over the ideals in which we believe and to bring about the abandonment of philosophies in which we do not believe, by direct and forcible intervention in each other's affairs."
22,1967,BRB,"While we scrupulously refrain from intervention in their domestic affairs, it is natural that we should feel a deep and friendly concern for their problems."
22,1967,ROU,"The situation in the Middle East involves many problems which have been awaiting solution for a long time, many of them being fostered and aggravated by the intervention of foreign imperialist interests—the only ones with anything to gain from war."
22,1967,CMR,"Even in politics, when intervention is not proportionate to the initial act, assistance or self-defence rapidly takes on the look of provocation as a pretext for aggression."
22,1967,CMR,"Hence in our view, the role of the socialist countries, assuming that socialism is idealistic and is concerned to play a decisive role in the evolution of the world, should today take the form of bold intervention in world trade so as to bring about, with the opening up of its closed markets, a quantitative acceleration of consumption of commodities, accompanied by an organization of the market for those commodities on the basis of prices geared to development."
22,1967,AUS,"Subversion, infiltration, foreign intervention to exploit local differences and sometimes even direct attack have added to their insecurity."
22,1967,AUS,"But the countries of the region have a real and common problem, which is how to bring about a situation in which they can live alongside mainland China free from the fear of intervention and aggression, from the export of world revolution as interpreted by Peking and practiced by the Red Guards, That remains the major task for the diplomacy of the region and indeed of the world."
22,1967,ETH,"While the flame of war has been extinguished, thanks mainly to the timely intervention of the United Nations, the smoke released by it still hangs heavily and the embers are still burning."
22,1967,CYP,"As far as the substance of the problem is concerned, the position of the Cyprus Government remains unchanged, namely, that the future of Cyprus must be, and can only be, determined in accordance with the wishes of the people of Cyprus, without any foreign intervention or interference and in conformity with the universally accepted democratic principles enshrined in the Charter, as spelled out in General Assembly resolution 2077 (XX) of 18 December 1965."
22,1967,DZA,"Contradiction between words and deeds: where the word spells liberation, it is called aggression; where the act is aggression, it is called liberation; where there is a spontaneous revolutionary uprising it is called foreign intervention; where there is foreign intervention, it is described as legitimate self-defence; where it is legitimate self-defence, the talk is of subversiveness."
22,1967,DZA,To persist today in placing on the same footing the intervention of a foreign Power in Viet-Nam and the perfectly natural solidarity between the parts of a single country and a single people is not merely to compound an injustice but also to reject any scale of recognized values.
22,1967,BEL,"In the present circumstances, it would be vain to count solely on what might emerge from an encounter between the parties concerned; and to believe that matters can be arranged by some friendly intervention alone, unless the fundamental principles I have cited are used as the basis for any future arrangement, is to believe in fairytales."
22,1967,KWT,"In that manner the people of Viet-Nam will be given the opportunity to decide its own future and to choose, without foreign intervention, the system of government and the form of national unity it prefers."
22,1967,THA,"In the first place, hostilities may cease altogether when the aggressors, realizing the hopelessness of their adventure, discontinue their infiltration and intervention against their neighbours."
22,1967,THA,"They may be persuaded to adopt this course on finding that the cost of aggression, in terms of the deterioration of their well-being and even their subsistence, is far too high, and on realization of the fact that it is not possible for them to achieve their objective through the use of subversion and armed intervention."
22,1967,MRT,The war in Viet-Nam is one of the most flagrant examples of the violation of the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States.
22,1967,ALB,"Having long been under the harmful influence of the United States of America and hence, in recent years, subject to the consequences of American-Soviet collusion, the United Nations has been transformed into an instrument for mystification and a centre for bargaining at the expense of the peoples, into an instrument for disguising the imperialist policy of aggression and oppression of peoples, into an instrument of pressure, intervention and aggression against freedom-loving peoples and countries."
22,1967,ALB,"They are firmly convinced that the heroic and revolutionary struggle of freedom-loving peoples and countries will totally destroy the imperialist policy of intervention, oppression and aggression, and that in the end that struggle will wipe out the imperialist system — a source of war, oppression and exploitation of the peoples — itself."
22,1967,SLV,"It is the principle of non-intervention, which we regard as one of the pillars of the inter-American legal system."
22,1967,SLV,"El Salvador has fought for the acceptance and observance of this principle as a rule of law vital to international coexistence, and we continue to oppose all intervention, of whatever kind and from whatever quarter, in the internal affairs of another State."
22,1967,SLV,"Thus we must repeat that we utterly condemn all the infringements still being perpetrated against national sovereignty and self-determination, even if they do not constitute direct intervention."
22,1967,LBN,"In his intervention on 3 October he repudiated the General Armistice Agreements and called for the conclusion of peace treaties between Israel and the Arab States, asserting that: ""Apart from the cease-fire agreement, there are now no valid effective contractual engagements between the States of the Middle East."
22,1967,HUN,"The war in Viet-Nam, launched by United States intervention and aggression, not only is a most inhuman sort of vandalism in itself, directed against the very existence of a nation, but also, on the one hand, may lead to major international armed confrontations of incalculable dimensions, and, on the other hand, already overshadows the whole world."
22,1967,FRA,"In the second case, there can of course be no question of outside intervention, and what each of us must do is scrupulously maintain the relations that are normal between sovereign countries."
22,1967,GMB,"We recognize, however, the difficulties and dangers which armed intervention in Rhodesia might pose, not only for Britain but more particularly also for Rhodesia's neighbours."
22,1967,ARG,"These violations consisted in the instigation and organization of subversive activities, terrorism and other forms of intervention designed to change the regime of another State by violence."
22,1967,SWE,Situations which undoubtedly constitute threats to the peace or breaches of the peace—even a major war like the one in Viet-Nam — can continue for years without any United Nations intervention at all.
22,1967,SWE,There are different opinions about the motives behind the decisions to request United Nations intervention on these and other problems.
22,1967,SWE,There is outside intervention on a massive scale.
22,1967,ECU,The declaration in resolution 2131 (XX) is the corner-stone of the prohibition of intervention in the domestic affairs of States and of the protection of their independence and sovereignty.
22,1967,ECU,"This General Assembly resolution is the statement of a general legal conviction, since the principle of non-intervention is considered one of the bases of the international juridical order."
22,1967,CUB,"Did the Yankee puppeteer and his Latin-American puppets believe that they were going to worry Cuba with that contrived transfer, aimed at playing down the ridiculous failure of its repugnant machinations? Did they imagine for one second that they could put Cuba in the dock, for nine years the victim of their policy of harassment, intervention, aggression, provocation, subversion, terrorism, sabotage and economic blockade? The puppeteer must be crazy, and his puppets very simple."
22,1967,CUB,"A few months after the military occupation of the Dominican Republic, and in the middle of its invasion by the Green Berets, the representatives of the fascist gorillas, the oligarchies and the feudal systems met in Washington with the absolute monarch of world- intervention and subversion to accuse Cuba of intervention and subversion in Venezuela on the ground of its policy of solidarity with the revolutionary movement; but our people devoted themselves wholeheartedly to their work, singing their cheerful refrain: ""Despite the OAS, we shall win the battle""."
22,1967,CUB,"It is clear that the absolute monarch of intervention and subversion and his lackeys, no longer able to undertake military adventures in Cuba without encountering a Bay of Pigs at every corner, entangled in the web of their own contradictions, perfidy, clumsiness, lies and failures, do not know how to get out of the mire in which their own insensibility, arrogance and stubbornness have landed them."
22,1967,CUB,"The acts of harassment, subversion, intervention and blockade by the United States against Cuba started at the very outset of the revolution."
22,1967,CUB,And what did the OAS do? What did the United Nations do except laugh at the United States delegate's lies and turn a deaf ear to my own statements backed by ample evidence? And are this guilty Government and its puppet accomplices those who now have the impudence to accuse Cuba of intervention and subversion? I will leave the guilty to speak for themselves.
22,1967,CUB,"On 17 April 1961 the Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, referring to the invasion, said that the fight in Cuba was a fight by Cubans for their own freedom, and that there was not and would not be any intervention by United States forces in that country."
22,1967,CUB,"Ross on the part played by the CIA in the Cuban invasion, and to tell the General Assembly whether or not those acts amount to intervention, aggression and subversion."
22,1967,CUB,"I also challenge the Latin-American delegations to explain their conspiratorial silence in the OAS when those events took place, although Cuba was still a member of that organization; and 1 call on them to show on what moral, reasonable or legal grounds their Governments can accuse Cuba of intervention and subversion."
22,1967,CUB,"Do international laws exempt the Government of the United States from complying with them? Do the Charters signed at San Francisco, or at Bogotá setting up the OAS, grant the imperialist Government of Washington a pirate's licence legalizing what for other governments is intervention, aggression, provocation and subversion? It is quite unnecessary to ask such questions."
22,1967,CUB,"While speaking of Yankee imperialism and its policy of intervention and aggression, it is very appropriate to stress that there were people in this Assembly who hypocritically rent their garments and again made empty promises of peace in Viet-Nam while the bombs, the splinters, the napalm and the poison gases wrought havoc and the incursions into Laos and the provocation in Cambodia continued."
22,1967,CUB,"The serious crisis in the Near East is another result of the policy of intervention, aggression, subversion and plundering of Yankee imperialism throughout the world."
22,1967,CUB,"As Commander Fidel Castro, Prime Minister of the Revolutionary Government of Cuba, has said, all those who have set out to rob the peoples of their wealth, stop their development, profit from their work, cut down their independence, attack their sovereignty, overrun them and exploit them with blood and fire, and all who support imperialists in their new plans for intervention, aggression, subversion and blockade against Cuba, should in every corner of the whole world be known by their true name — bandits! Fatherland or death! We shall win!."
22,1967,POL,American intervention began to undermine and violate the Geneva Agreements.
22,1967,POL,This very intervention constantly threatens Cambodia and Laos.
22,1967,POL,"It was American aggression that paralysed the activities of the International Commission on Supervision and Control, established to supervise the implementation of the Geneva Agreements following the withdrawal of French colonial troops from Indochina, Today the Commission is not able to deal with the armed intervention of the United States forces in Viet-Nam."
22,1967,POL,"In spite of the fact that as a result of the American intervention the Commission is at present unable to discharge its functions properly, our representatives on the Commission remain at their posts."
22,1967,POL,"Whether called 'intervention’, 'reprisals’ or 'collective defense’, the United States response by bombings in North Viet-Nam, which began in February, 1965, violated international law, the United Nations Charter, and the Geneva Agreement, if the latter were in effect."
22,1967,ISL,"In my intervention in the general debate at the last session of the General Assembly [1430th meeting], I drew attention to the second most important role of the United Nations, Its primary role will, for a long time to come, be the prevention of war."
22,1967,COL,"On the other hand, the persistent, blatant and calculated action of the Government of Cuba in intervening in the internal affairs of the Latin American countries is beyond all doubt a scandalous violation of the principle of non-intervention enshrined in the United Nations Charter and in General Assembly resolution 2131 (XX)."
22,1967,JOR,I refer to non-intervention by any State in the internal affairs of other States.
22,1967,UKR,"In his statement at the conference on foreign policy matters held in Washington in May 1967, he stated, inter alia: ""Under what conditions should we or should we not intervene? It is extraordinarily difficult to define clear-cut criteria; but as a broad generalization, it might be said that intervention is justified whenever its absence will create regional instability of expanding proportions."
22,1967,UKR,It is that distinction which justifies intervention — it is that distinction which warrants our involvement today in the effort to create regional stability in South-East Asia.
22,1967,PER,"What remains, beneath the mounds of rubble in Viet-Nam, of the great principles of independence, self-determination, neutrality and non-intervention?  13."
22,1967,PER,"We are proud that, in the course of the international history of the Americas, we often took the initiative in diplomatic and even military measures — in 1847, 1856 and 1866 for example — to reject intervention in the Americas by those who would have conspired against our political regime and our institutions."
22,1967,PER,"Our position in those instances was one of consistent opposition to intervention, as it was in the case of other problems which arose within the geographical area of the American continent."
22,1967,PER,"We would therefore be failing to live up to the demands of our history and abandoning our faith in the democratic solidarity of the Americas were we not prepared to oppose any form of intervention, whether it comes, unfortunately, from another American republic or whether its source lies in ill-concealed political interests outside the continent."
22,1967,CHL,"The question is not even on the General Assembly’s agenda, A political, not a military solution is what is needed in this war, and it must necessarily take account of the principles in whose name this political Assembly is meeting; I refer mainly to the principles of non-intervention and self-determination."
22,1967,CHL,"We have followed the Secretary-General’s personal intervention with sympathetic Interest; but its results have highlighted the utter inability of the Organization, as such, to assume responsibility for this problem."
22,1967,CHL,"In this way Chile shows that its essentially pacifist policy, based on absolute non-intervention, does not in any way call for armaments that affect the security of other countries of the region, and far less for the acquisition of arms or military devices that impede the harmonious economic and integrated development of the region."
22,1967,CHL,"But although this is not yet possible despite the fact that the vigilant conscience of the people is working seriously in that direction, there is one principle that is essential: it is the principle of non-intervention."
22,1967,CHL,"Our concept of ideological, political and economic plurality, and at the same time the process of integration, obliges us to keep this principle of non-intervention, which is a historic basis of our country's international policy, in full operation."
22,1967,CHL,"My country was not acting out of expediency when it supported that statement condemning intervention, nor shall we agree to any weakening or alteration of its terms."
22,1967,RUS,"Taking part in the intervention against the Viet-Namese people are such allies of the United States as Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, South Korea and the Philippines."
22,1967,COD,"Our feeling is that once foreign intervention ends in Viet-Nam and there is a return to the 1954 Geneva Agreements, the Viet-Namese people will be able to settle their own affairs in accordance with their entirely legitimate aspirations."
22,1967,CSK,"In various parts of the world, we see the overt and unrestrained use of force, acts of aggression and armed intervention against nations that have chosen the path of independence and progress, and the systematic flouting of the generally recognized principles of international law and of the fundamental principles of the United Nations, by which relations among States and nations should be governed."
22,1967,CSK,"The General Assembly must use all the means at its disposal to help to direct the development of the situation towards better results and to restore international legality, which has been violated by the arbitrary use of force in international relations, by intervention in the internal affairs of various States and nations, and by the suppression of national liberation movements of the peoples of colonial and dependent territories."
22,1967,KHM,"The truth is that, as that great statesman General de Gaulle says, the Viet-Nam affair is a battle by a national resistance against foreign armed intervention."
22,1967,KHM,"But — and we must be under no delusion about this — the South Viet-Namese people will fight for ten years, twenty years if need be, against the American army of occupation for the right to settle its internal affairs without foreign interference or intervention."
22,1967,KHM,"For us Cambodians, non-intervention and non-interference in the affairs of others are sacred principles, and we can never accept the idea of any foreign Power whatsoever imposing its own régime or ideology by violence or by any other means."
24,1969,BDI,"But we must stress that the intervention of exports or of foreign officials is in the nature of an exception, which can be justified only as a measure of first aid until qualified national personnel can take over."
24,1969,BLR,"Unilateral declarations of so-called obligations do not create any basis in international law for intervention in the affairs of other peoples, and cannot deprive the people of Viet-Nam of the right to fight against the aggressors and decide its own destiny as it sees fit."
24,1969,BLR,These proposals are designed to eliminate one of the hotbeds of tension in the Far East and to protect the inalienable right of the Korean people to live without foreign occupation and without imperialist intervention in its domestic affairs.
24,1969,SOM,I should like to begin my intervention by presenting my most sincere congratulations to the President on her election to the high office of President of this session of the United Nations General Assembly.
24,1969,LUX,"It therefore remains to be hoped that the positive gestures that have been made repeatedly by the United States Government will meet with a real response, and that both sides will agree to give the people of Viet-Nam complete freedom to decide their own fate, safe from intimidation and from threats of overt or covert intervention from abroad."
24,1969,BEL,"How can we preserve the fiction of the internal nature of conflicts such as that between Nigeria and Biafra when such a war cannot continue or be supplied except through foreign intervention and when, in fact, we are witnesses of a transfer of responsibility at the international level? We have often spoken about this general problem with various European and African colleagues in the light of present examples, and we have become convinced that the United Nations must examine it in all its aspects."
24,1969,ARG,"The Argentine Republic wishes once again to reaffirm its deep faith in the principles which are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, The sovereign equality of States, the self-determination of peoples, the peaceful settlement of international disputes, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms without racial, religious or any other form of distinction, respect for the territorial integrity of States, non-intervention and international co-operation constitute the basic rules of an international order designed to ensure peace among nations."
24,1969,CHL,"Secondly, there must be a clear recognition of the principles of equality of States; non-intervention in the internal or external affairs of other States in any form whatsoever which constitutes an attack on the personality of the State and its political, economic and cultural elements; respect for the validity of treaties; the sovereign right of each country to dispose freely of its natural resources; and of the fact that economic co-operation cannot be subjected to political or military conditions."
24,1969,BWA,"We recognize that these proposals, endorsed by an unrepresentative electorate, end the prospect of a peaceful transition to majority rule without some form of external intervention to secure it."
24,1969,TZA,"If the nuclear Powers had an untainted history of peace and non-intervention, it might have been easier for non-nuclear States to accept the views of the nuclear Powers on this matter if these latter had consistently shown a concern for the universal development of peace based on justice."
24,1969,MMR,"Even when we are faced with the most challenging problems, problems that have so far defied all solution, there are at present some discordant voices, impervious to current international realities, calling for more interference and intervention on the part of certain big Powers in the affairs of small countries."
24,1969,CIV,"Yet, because of the intervention of some great Powers and with their connivance, this war is being waged with the most modern and sophisticated weapons; British and Russian bombs are being dropped by Ilyushin planes on defenceless villages."
24,1969,CIV,"But I am convinced that the United Nations will answer our appeal and not disappear in the face of this horrible war which is devastating Biafra, however ill-advised the intervention of the great Powers."
24,1969,MLI,"But we are still convinced that a just peace for the populations both of North and South should be negotiated and freely determined by the genuine representatives  of the whole people of Viet-Nam, without any foreign pressure or intervention whatsoever, in accordance with the Geneva Agreements of 1954."
24,1969,MLI,"For the benefit of those Governments which may still doubt the will of the People’s Republic of China to respect the obligations, purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, I will cite a passage from the statement made at Peking on 30 September 1969 by the Prime Minister, Chou En-lai, who said:  “The peace that we seek is based on five principles: mutual respect for territorial integrity and for sovereignty;  mutual non-aggression; mutual non-intervention in internal affairs; equality and reciprocal advantages; and peaceful coexistence."
24,1969,NLD,"This feeling of concern, which I voiced at last year’s session of the Assembly [1681st meeting] on account of the situation in Czechoslovakia, is due to the fact that the Soviet Union has made it clear in word and deed that it is not considering itself bound by one of the fundamental principles of international law: that is to say, the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs and respect for the sovereignty of other nations."
24,1969,NLD,My fellow representatives may remember that even last: year I mentioned during my intervention in the general debate [1681st meeting] the desirability of seeking by common action ways and means of reinforcing the Organization’s  efficacy.
24,1969,ROU,"The bankruptcy of the policy of force is fully illustrated by the failure of the foreign intervention in Viet-Nam, where it has been confronted by the unflinching will of the people of Viet-Nam to defend its right to choose and freely to pursue its own social and political development."
24,1969,ROU,"By mobilizing all their energies to oppose the United States intervention with a courage and strength born solely of faith in a just cause, the people of Viet-Nam has provided irrefutable factual evidence that a people defending its sacred right to a free and independent existence cannot be overcome."
24,1969,DZA,"Deprived of the means of dissuasion and intervention necessary for any effective action, it sees its decisions systematically ignored and its authority flouted."
24,1969,LKA,"It is a truism that international peace and security can be ensured only if in their international relations all Governments accept and observe the principles of peaceful coexistence between States irrespective of their social or economic systems, respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States, renunciation of the threat or use of force in the settlement of disputes between countries, abstention from intervention or interference in the internal affairs of countries, and promotion of mutual interests and co-operation  between States."
24,1969,GIN,Has not the United Kingdom recently proved its sacred colonial principles and its colonial mission are still in full force by its dramatic intervention to repress a so-called rebellion in the tiny island of Anguilla and to safeguard what it calls the rule of law?  182.
24,1969,DOM,We refer to my country’s refusal to accept any kind of intervention by States in the internal affairs of other States.
24,1969,DOM,"My Government considers that, in view of this situation, we must devise means of restoring peace in the zone of hostilities and of putting an end to the tragedy that has been going on there for so long, without infringing the right of non-intervention."
24,1969,MRT,"The greatest Power in the world today obstinately continues to wage unsuccessfully an unjust war, thereby imposing great hardship and considerable material loss upon an entire people whose only crime is a wish to exercise, in  the freedom and respect to which it is entitled from all, the  tight to choose its own destiny in all freedom, without any foreign intervention."
24,1969,LSO,It is to be hoped that these Powers will realize the futility of their intervention and will co-operate with this Organization in urging the parties to the conflict to reach a negotiated settlement based on mutual trust.
24,1969,MNG,"Tsedenbal, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People’s Republic, said in his statement at the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers’ Parties on 13 June 1969:  “Resorting to the widest variety of means, including provocation, counter-revolutionary conspiracy, reactionary uprisings and armed intervention, imperialism is trying to impose its policy on the peoples of the world by force and artificiality to maintain constant tension in international relations."
24,1969,SDN,"future” without “outside” intervention [1755th meeting, para."
24,1969,SDN,"One fails to comprehend the logic that permits the Americans to accept that the activities of the South Viet-Namese Liberation Front, even if aided by the North Viet-Namese, can be considered as unjustifiable foreign intervention, while the American military machine, aided by Australian, South Korean, New Zealand, Thai and Filipino forces, can legitimately and justifiably bring death and destruction to the poor people of Viet-Nam."
24,1969,AFG,In such a structure we consider that foreign intervention  is fraught with the greatest danger of setting off a new power struggle.
24,1969,BOL,"To those principles, which form the framework of the United Nations, there must be added the principle of non-intervention, which denounces those who export revolution  and foment subversion and hatred in other countries."
24,1969,BOL,"As everyone knows, Bolivia has been the subject of certain amount of international notoriety which we did not seek and do not wish to see repeated—notoriety caused by just such foreign intervention, the only result of which was the death of Bolivian citizens, some as victims of violence and others because they were deceived by the seductive talk of foreign agents."
24,1969,KHM,"The only reasonable and honourable outcome of the war in Viet-Nam, which has lasted far too long, is the total and unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops and bases from South Viet-Nam and effective respect for the right of the Viet-Namese people to settle their own affairs, including reunification, without foreign intervention or interference."
24,1969,KHM,"In accordance with the principles and ideals which are the raison d’étre of the United Nations, we request that the 40 million Koreans should at long last be allowed freely to achieve the reunification of their country, without any outside intervention or interference, including that of the United Nations."
24,1969,PER,The international order repudiates all forms of intervention.
24,1969,PER,We therefore consider that any measure of pressure or sanction against Peru for defending its public oil heritage and its new energy policy would be tantamount to open intervention and economic aggression in violation of international undertakings which were considered to have replaced the old system of diplomatic protection so abusively used in the past to shield financial interests.
24,1969,PER,"But that system, of which so much could be said by the developing countries, is one which we are putting an end to once and for all, since it bespoke a form of intervention which Peru has always rejected; and we are rejecting it again from this rostrum, since we regard it as not only an attack on the independence of States, but also as totally contrary to the noble principles of the United Nations."
24,1969,PER,"We must point out clearly—and we do so at this Assembly—that we envisage international co-operation as a  commitment free from all forms of intervention in the internal or external affairs of other States and from any encroachment on their integrity and the political, economic and cultural elements which constitute it; that we believe rational exploitation of national resources indispensable for the preservation and development of each country; that we cannot accept economic co-operation subject to political or military conditions; that we cannot admit the use or encouragement of measures of economic or political coercion  designed to force the sovereign will of States in order to obtain advantages of any sort; and, finally, that we reject the adoption, indeed the very existence, of policies, actions or measures the mere invoking of which might threaten the economic and social development of a country and could lead to covert or open forms of economic aggression."
24,1969,LBY,"It is the Libyan people who have suffered under the yoke of imperialism and foreign intervention, and it is they who were victimized by a corrupt and reactionary regime."
24,1969,LBY,"Its protestations notwithstanding, the United Kingdom  Government has declined to render any effective intervention."
24,1969,BRA,"There is a loss of confidence in the organized action of the international community and an abusive and unwarranted return to unilateral action, to intervention, open or disguised."
24,1969,BRA,"The sovereign equality of States, good faith in international relations, the use of peaceful means for the settlement of disputes, the abandonment of the use of force, strict adherence to obligations arising from treaties and other international agreements, co-operation to maintain peace as well as to achieve economic, social and cultural progress, non-discrimination, respect for the self-determination of peoples, non-intervention—these make an impressive programme, to which we can still today give our most conscientious and firm support, as we did twenty-five years ago."

04,1949,CSK,"On the other hand, the so-called peace and order maintained by means of intervention and at a sacrifice of countless lives was not even a permanent solution."
04,1949,CAN,"There would be a great deal to recommend such intervention if it could be carried out firmly and quickly; but the fact was, of course, that the Security Council had at that time no effective way of imposing its will."
04,1949,PER,"It was necessary to emphasize the right of free development, not merely from a political but also from a juridical and cultural angle, and to condemn not only political intervention, but also intervention in the economic and cultural spheres."
04,1949,PER,Belaunde recalled the meeting of the Congress of lawyers in Lima which had condemned such forms of intervention.
04,1949,FRA,"If the United Nations had been called upon — and rightly so — to intervene in a domestic dispute which had for years been ravaging a noble and courageous country, it was because intervention by other countries had threatened, and still threatened, to endanger international peace and security."
04,1949,FRA,"While the Assembly was still attached to the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of States, whether Members of the Organization or not, it could not ignore the violation of the essential rights which it had solemnly recognized as belonging to all human beings."
04,1949,CUB,"In its national foreign policy, Cuba had upheld the principle of non-intervention and respect for the sovereignty of States; the memorable occasion of the Seventh International Conference of American States at Montevideo was an eloquent example of its line of conduct, 67."
04,1949,POL,"It considered that the first necessary step in that direction was the withdrawal of the armies of intervention, those of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands."
04,1949,SLV,"The representative of El Salvador said that the Assembly had unfortunately erred by departing from some of the basic principles of the Charter, namely, the principle that there should be no intervention in the internal affairs of States and the principle that all peoples should have the right of self-determination."
04,1949,SLV,"The delegation of El Salvador, which had always been a fervent advocate of the principle of non-intervention, had carefully studied the argument advanced in the cases of Bulgaria and Hungary."
04,1949,SLV,"That argument invoked the principle of non-intervention, according to which the General Assembly of the United Nations had no right to intervene in problems relating to the rights of individuals in those countries and in the administration of justice, since that was the domestic function of their Governments."
04,1949,SLV,"Castro recalled that the attitude of the delegation of El Salvador towards the question of Greece, which was still threatened by the constant, intervention of various neighbouring States, had already been clearly defined."
04,1949,LBR,"With regard to the Indonesian question, the Liberian delegation hoped that the negotiations being conducted at The Hague between the Netherlands Government and the representatives of the Indonesian Republic would terminate in such a manner as to ensure lasting peace between those two Governments as well as the happiness and prosperity of the peoples of the two countries, without any further intervention on the part of the United Nations."
04,1949,ISR,It had become generally recognized that the Arab States and Israel needed a maximum of contact and a minimum of intervention in order to settle the political problems still outstanding between them.
04,1949,VEN,"The interpretation of the provisions of the Charter had given rise to contradictory decisions and violent statements, in particular whenever attempts had been made to determine the exact scope of the principle of non-intervention set forth in paragraph 7 of Article 2, safeguarding the sovereignty of States Members in matters which were essentially within their domestic jurisdiction."
04,1949,VEN,"The Venezuelan delegation considered that an effort should be made to define the scope of the principle of non-intervention, as set forth in the Charter, in the light of those provisions of the Charter which established the general principles of international co-operation in the economic, social, cultural and humanitarian fields."
04,1949,DOM,"Not only was the sacred principle of independence attacked by such threats but also another principle, that of non-intervention, which the American Republics had embodied in many treaties and declarations."
04,1949,YUG,"Lastly, at the very time when there was so much talk about the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other countries, it was clear that, in fact, such intervention had become the principal instrument of the foreign policy of the great Powers, and that it constituted the main reason for fearing a new war."
04,1949,YUG,"If the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of States were respected, it was obvious that difference of social structure did not constitute a threat of war."
04,1949,YUG,"It could be said, therefore, that the threat of war was due, not to differences in social structure, but to the existence of imperialistic and antidemocratic tendencies in international, relations, to the violation of the principle of equality of the rights of States and peoples, to the economic exploitation of other nations, and to intervention in the domestic affairs of other States."
04,1949,YUG,"It was impossible to talk about non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States, while occupying a position such as that taken by the USSR towards Yugoslavia, an independent State."

41,1986,ARE,"We appreciate the positive posture of brotherly Iraq towards the international initiatives and efforts undertaken to end the war, including its recent peace proposals and we appeal- to the Islamic Republic of Iran to follow suit and show that it wishes to end the war in the interests of stability and security in the region, and to avert the danger of foreign intervention."
41,1986,ARE,"Israel's intervention in the internal affairs of Lebanon, its occupation of part of Lebanon's territory in violation of the resolutions of the Security Council and the principles of international conduct, together with its continued threats and acts of aggression, are a major reason for the protracted Lebanese conflict."
41,1986,ARE,"Thus the restoration of stability in Lebanon is tied to a large degree to Israel's withdrawal from the Lebanese territory that it occupies, and its abstention from intervention in Lebanon's internal affairs."
41,1986,ARE,"Just as we have always affirmed the principles of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States, the non-use of force or the threat of force, and the settlement of international disputes by peaceful means, so we emphasize the need to reach a comprehensive political settlement in Afghanistan that will put an end to foreign intervention and guarantee complete respect for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-aligned status of that country."

41,1986,IRN,"We even faced direct American military intervention in Tabas, followed by sanctions and a full-fledged propaganda war."
41,1986,IRN,"But if Iran is subjected to foreign intervention, to naked aggression or to an economic blockade, nothing seems to take place."
41,1986,IRN,One of the most crucial tasks of our countries is to achieve this position and as soon as we have we shall be able to eradicate the sources of foreign intervention.
41,1986,IRN,"The unconditional and immediate withdrawal of the occupation forces, recognition of the Afghan people's right to self-determination, voluntary repatriation of Afghan refugees and non-intervention by foreigners in the internal affairs of Afghanistan must constitute the essence of any solution to that country's problems."
41,1986,IRN,"Latin America and the Caribbean region are still suffering from the vestiges of dependent military governments, huge economic difficulties and encroachment upon their sovereignty, in the past year, the danger of United States direct military intervention and aggressive acts against these countries has intensified."
41,1986,MRT,"As far as Kampuchea is concerned, our country renews its support for the relevant General Assembly resolution and affirms the need for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from that country so that the people of Kampuchea can determine their future free from any foreign intervention."

41,1986,NIC,"There have been many appeals to the United States Government to abandon its illegal policy of intervention and force against Nicaragua and bring its conduct into line with the norms of law, as befits a world super-Power and a permanent member of the Security Council."
41,1986,NIC,"It condemned the United States for its illegal policy of intervention and force against Nicaragua, a small, impoverished nation, which to defend its inalienable right to independence and self-determination has only the indestructible will of its people, the solidarity of the nations and peoples of the world and, most especially, international law, justice and morality."
41,1986,NIC,"At present it is clear that international peace and security depend on full compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter: the sovereign equality of States, the political independence and self-determination of peoples, non-use of force in international relations, non-intervention in the internal and external affairs of other States, and the peaceful solution of international disputes."
41,1986,NIC,"The Court ruled that the violations of international law committed by the United States through its aggressive actions against Nicaragua could not be justified either by the plea of collective self-defense, inasmuch as the condition sine qua non that would make it necessary had not been fulfilled, or by an alleged right of the United States to adopt counter measures involving the use of force in the face of a purported intervention by Nicaragua in El Salvador."
41,1986,NIC,"It must be added that the United States was unable to prove its repeated charges of intervention, despite - as was recognized by the International Court of Justice - ""the deployment by the United States in the region of extensive technical resources for tracking, monitoring and intercepting air, sea and land traffic"" and the active assistance of the Governments allegedly affected."

41,1986,ARG,"This mutual effort could be vain unless there is a third pledge that of the countries that have links and interests in the region to abstain from any kind of intervention, since what happens in the future will largely depend on them and since the peace and security of those nations is contingent upon satisfactory solution of the Central American conflict."
41,1986,VEN,"Heightened East-West tensions, based on the overflow of nuclear arsenals, the growing use of military force, and great-Power intervention in various regional scenarios - these are other symptoms of deterioration which augur ill for world peace and stability."
41,1986,VEN,"We believe that there are sufficient reasons to persist along this path, provided that there is an end to the obstinate attitude of those interests which are determined to prolong the atmosphere of confrontation prevailing in the area, spurred on by the intervention of outside factors that obstruct the attainment of a negotiated settlement of the crisis."
41,1986,CHL,"Chile has noted with great concern the serious deterioration in the observance of the principle of non-intervention, a legal principle essential to coexistence and the harmonious development of relations between States."
41,1986,CHL,Chile has had to reject many instances of intervention in its affairs in recent years.

41,1986,LUX,"We are convinced that foreign intervention, whatever its source and whoever its possible beneficiaries, is unlikely to foster a peaceful and democratic solution of the problems there."
41,1986,ECU,"The disproportionate size of the armies and of the stock of weapons,, the immoderate and open intervention of several Powers within the area, and the continued and deplorable installation of certain totalitarian systems keep on aggravating the tensions in that stricken area, of our Americas."
41,1986,ECU,"The international community, the regional and ad hoc forums, as well as the Contadora Group-itself will have to exert strong pressure to eliminate the causes of war 01 guerrillas in the Central American and to restore in the area the effective validity of the peoples' rights to self-determination, of democratic systems and of- non-intervention."
41,1986,AUT,The principles of peaceful settlement of disputes and non-intervention cannot be applied selectively.

41,1986,GRC,"Such a solution should also provide for a system of international guarantees, non-military in character, which should preclude the possibility of unilateral intervention, so that the security of the people of Cyprus in its entirety is effectively assured."
41,1986,GRC,Let me point out in this respect that the Turkish side has cynically declared that under any solution part of the Turkish Army would remain in Cyprus and that Ankara would insist upon a system of guarantees which would give it the right to unilateral military intervention.
41,1986,KEN,"In this connection, we must express our strong opposition to foreign intervention or interference in the internal affairs of sovereign, independent States."
41,1986,IDN,"Persistent resort to the threat or use of force in the settlement of disputes, aggression and racist oppression, intervention and economic coercion, have kept international tensions at undiminished levels, while posing a constant threat to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of States."

41,1986,HND,"Furthermore, my Government deplores the armed intervention in Afghanistan; it urges all States to respect the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence, and non-alignment of that country; and restates the need for an immediate, unconditional and total withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan."
41,1986,HND,"2) The Government of Honduras will maintain its full support for the peace initiatives of the Contadora Group, but the international community must realize that a negotiated resolution of the problems of our region will be achieved only whet the Soviet bloc decides to end its various methods of intervention in Central America, a region with which it has no relationship beyond the arrogant manifestations of its military machine."
41,1986,PRT,"We wish therefore to find a solution for the financial problems of the United Nations, not only for economic reasons, but because we want to see its capacity for intervention reinforced, its initiatives respected, and its voice listened to."
41,1986,CHN,"Owing to external intervention, the situation in Central America is becoming more complicated."

A just and lasting solution of these crises calls for renunciation of the policy of fait accompli and of the positions acquired by force, withdrawal of occupation forces, the cessation of all intervention and interference in internal affairs and, above all, the exercise by peoples of the right to self-determination, independence and free development."
41,1986,MOZ,It is contrary to ethics and to international law to link the independence of any people to issues extraneous to that people's country and concerning which they do not have the power of intervention or decision.
41,1986,LBR,"My Government rejects intervention, interference and armed occupation wherever they occur as an infringement of the Charter and the territorial integrity and sovereign rights of States."

41,1986,NPL,The sacrosanct doctrine of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of sovereign States is trampled underfoot.

41,1986,NPL,"My delegation has just expressed its concern regarding the situation obtaining in several parts of the Asian continent, which is conditioned by Nepal's well known commitment to peace and its conviction that the doctrine of non-interference and non-intervention must remain inviolable if the principles and ideals of the United Nations Charter are to continue to have any meaning or relevance."
41,1986,YMD,More acts of intervention in the affairs of the States of the region are taking place.

41,1986,DJI,"For several years Afghanistan, a peaceful, developing and non-aligned country, has been a victim of foreign intervention, in violation of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and of the obligation of all States to refrain, in their international relations, from the threat or use of force against the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of any State."
41,1986,DJI,It is now eight years since the Kampuchean people fell victim to foreign military intervention.
41,1986,SLV,"This is because the principles of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States, respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, the equality of sovereignty of those States, renunciation of the use or threat of force and co-operation in the development of all peoples constitute today more than ever before the fundamental principles of El Salvador's foreign policy, which is rooted in good faith and respect for and compliance with treaties."

41,1986,CYP,"I am convinced, however, that those differences would have been solved many years ago had it not been for the presence of the occupation troops and the foreign intervention."
41,1986,CYP,This can be achieved without foreign interference and intervention.

41,1986,MNG,"They seek to attain a military-strategic superiority and to achieve their neo-global is tic objectives through blackmail, sanctions and acts of State terrorism, including armed intervention against countries and peoples who refuse to submit to their diktat."

41,1986,PER,Complying with the principle of non-intervention is a basic obligation of international coexistence and the indispensable partner of the right to self-determination.
41,1986,PER,In Central America acts of intervention constitute the main obstacle to the peace efforts of the Con tad or a Group and the Support Group.
41,1986,PER,"It is therefore essential that an end be put to all acts of intervention, coercion and harassment that can rekindle violence and cause an escalation of the conflict."

41,1986,CUB,Our America has been the theater of imperialist intervention.
41,1986,CUB,"If we were to mention all United States interventions in Latin America - from Mexico to Argentina, from Cuba to Grenada, from the Dominican Republic and Haiti to Colombia and should we include the regimes installed or kept in power through open imperialist intervention, the map of the continent would be filled in without exception."
41,1986,ISL,"or shall I let him fall?"" Hera replied that such an intervention would only arouse the anger of the other gods, with unforeseeable consequences, since ""a number of combatants at Troy are the sons of gods."
41,1986,MMR,"The restoration of their independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity requires the withdrawal of foreign troops and non-intervention by other States in the country's internal affairs."
41,1986,MMR,"The principle of non-intervention in the affairs of other States, which is one of the mainstays of stable inter-State relations, has been ignored by the South African regime."
41,1986,ALB,"Moreover, the new theories and concepts advocated by Washington and Moscow -such as ""neo-globalism"" and a ""global system of security"" - really differ only in form from the old ones and are basically just a means of justifying local conflicts, blackmail, the nuclear threat and even direct armed intervention against sovereign peoples and countries."
41,1986,ALB,The bitter history of the past is remembered to this very day and teaches the peoples of the Balkans not to be taken in by the dangerous games of the imperialist Powers  and to avoid and overcome the negative factors which create favorable ground for the increasing intervention by the super-Powers in the region.
41,1986,FIN,In my intervention I have emphasized the unique role of the United Nations based upon the Charter.

41,1986,MWI,"While it is true, of course, that areas of tension and conflict in the various regions of the world remain, I believe it is equally true that it is because of the Secretary-General* s initiatives, as well as his personal intervention, that many of these conflicts have been prevented from escalating to more dangerous levels; and, in some cases, inter-State tensions have also been prevented from developing into open conflicts."
41,1986,MWI,"We therefore continue to follow the Secretary-General's efforts in the search for a solution to the problem of Cyprus, whose Greek and Turkish communities remain divided as a result of foreign intervention."
41,1986,HUN,"Encouragement of violence and armed intervention, whether direct or indirect, does not solve the problems but, on the contrary, aggravates the situation."

70,2015,DJI,"In this connection, we welcome the military intervention of brotherly countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, led by Saudi Arabia in Yemen, at the request of President Hadi Mansour."
70,2015,BEN,"Eight hundred Beninese soldiers, many of them trained for action and intervention as part of United Nations peacekeeping operations, shall take their place beside to their sisters and brothers in arms."
70,2015,NIC,The Organization must respond in the face of that barbaric intervention in and interruption of the tranquillity and the right to prosperity in the lives of millions of families of countries and entire populations.

70,2015,KGZ,"We believe that respect for and guarantees of the right of every State to development should in time become the foundation for forging new, equitable international relations at the global level and should take their place alongside such other principles as respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, rejection of the use of force and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States."
70,2015,KGZ,We believe that external intervention in any conflict should remain a last resort and should be used only with the approval of the Security Council.

70,2015,VAT,"Yet it is not always easy to carry out that duty in practice, not the least because its observance often conflicts with a strict literal interpretation of the principle of non-intervention, as sanctioned by paragraph 7 of Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations."
70,2015,VAT,"There is also the suspicion, historically founded, that under the guise of humanitarian intervention, the principle of the sovereign equality of the Members of the United Nations, established in paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Charter, could end up being overridden."
70,2015,VAT,"The principle of non-intervention, sanctioned in paragraph 7 of that Article, together with paragraphs 3 and 4, excludes all unilateral use of force against another Member of the United Nations and demands full respect for Governments that are lawfully constituted and recognized."
70,2015,VAT,"Where gross violations of human rights persist and further intervention is considered necessary, the only other recourse is to apply the measures set forth in Chapters VI and VII of the Charter."

53,1998,LBY,"What kind of peace is it that prevents a people from returning to their territory, their homeland? The continued occupation of the Syrian Golan since 1967, the occupation of southern Lebanon, and the way in which the Security Council has been prevented from implementing its resolution 425 (1978) are further proof of the weakening of the United Nations as a result of the intervention of the major Powers."

53,1998,UGA,We would like to say that unilateral military intervention by individual countries or sectional intervention by groups of countries is unacceptable.
53,1998,UGA,"If there are good reasons for an intervention, it should be regional, carried out, for example, through the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the Organization of African Unity (OAU) or 19   even the United Nations, and in the context of the peace initiatives that are already in place."

53,1998,SGP,"Today, that market is $1 trillion and Central Bank intervention in foreign exchange becomes an exercise in futility."
53,1998,ESP,"Some good examples, in addition to the Stabilization Force (SFOR) and Operation Alba — to cite two cases in which Spain respectively continues to play and played a particularly prominent role — are initiatives such as the Stand-by Forces High-Readiness Brigade (SHIRBRIG), which can 27   speed up United Nations intervention considerably, and in which Spain is also beginning to participate."

25,1970,ALB,"A recent example which is the best illustration of what awaits the American imperialists and their policy of intervention and war is the armed aggression they perpetrated against Cambodia last March, immediately after the coup d'etat which they plotted in that country."
25,1970,ALB,"At the same time, American imperialism, by statements from Nixon, Laird and other leaders, threatens to intervene in the internal affairs of the Arab countries and also threatens intervention by its Sixth Fleet, thus trying, as always, to play the role of international policeman to oppress peoples and suppress liberation struggles, to defend those cliques which are in their pockets, to defend their rapacious interests and to enslave peoples."
25,1970,ALB,"The Soviet revisionists in particular are showing special haste, which can be explained by their internal difficulties, the ever growing resistance of the countries of Eastern Europe to their policy of intervention and domination, by their plans and preparations for aggression directed towards Asia against the People's Republic of China."

25,1970,GIN,"If we can on the one hand take pleasure to a certain extent from the balance sheet of the activities of certain specialized agencies of the United Nations and on the other hand of the partial results of decolonization, we are nonetheless forced to note that foreign intervention, colonial domination and the designs of imperialists against the sovereignty of the peoples in the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Latin America, disarmament, the question of faithful and sincere international cooperation, the universality of the Organization today still constitute the major concerns of mankind."

14,1959,LAO,"Among the Organization's achievements during the past year, there was in first instance its happy intervention in the Middle East, which served to prevent irrevocable actions and to create an atmosphere conducive to the easing of tensions, to peace and tranquillity in an area notorious for its extreme sensitivity to political events."

14,1959,FRA,"What I want to say for the future, and for the present session in particular, is that, even if the' United Nations has decided to go beyond the bounds of competence laid down for it in the Charter, I do not really see how it could now justify an intervention."
14,1959,CHL,"At the Santiago Conference, the principle of non-intervention was of course reaffirmed."

14,1959,CUB,"The same interests, which remained silent, solely for reasons of expediency, in the face of the horrible crimes committed by Batista, are those which now, in collusion with a few senators and the Cuban war criminals, are instigating, organizing and financing this campaign, the primary purpose of which is to create an international climate favourable both to counter-revolutionary invasions having their headquarters in Miami and in the Dominican Republic, such as the one which was recently discovered and crushed, and to foreign intervention on the false pretext of ""Communist infiltration in official circles""."
14,1959,CUB,"But neither this malicious campaign, nor these preposterous schemes, nor this threat of foreign intervention will make us yield an inch in our defence of the right of self-determination of the Cuban people and of the progressive development of our revolution."
14,1959,CUB,"Cuba also succeeded in having the meetings open to the public, and publicly championed the principle of non-intervention, respect for human rights, the inviolability of the right of asylum of exiles, the incompatibility of dictatorships with the inter-American legal system and the right of every State to reject any investigation into its internal affairs."

14,1959,COL,"In this connexion we would mention, as a step forward, the conclusions reached at the meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs at Santiago, Chile, where we affirmed that the support of peace in America required an active combination of democracy, respect for the principle of non-intervention, the defence and application of human rights, and the economic security of the individual."
14,1959,COL,"Colombia is convinced that, on the American continent and throughout the rest of the world, the principle of non-intervention should be respected by all countries."
14,1959,COL,"We have seen that intervention does not always take the clear-cut form of a frontal attack, but often, as the Argentine Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr."
14,1959,THA,"To us, small nations, the disease which plagues the world and poisons the relationship between nations resides mainly in continuous interference or even intervention from outside."
14,1959,THA,"At the same time, although the matter has been considered by the Security Council, it will be difficult to overlook the disturbed situation in Laos, where foreign intervention is threatening the national existence of a Member State."
14,1959,THA,"As the Sub-Committee appointed by the Security Council is now conducting its investigation and collecting evidence of that intervention, my delegation will only say that the above measure has already produced some tangible results for the restoration of peace and tranquillity."
14,1959,THA,"No clamour for peace or peacefulness, however loud it maybe, will be sufficient to ensure peace; if peace is to prevail, all these acts of intolerance, interference and intervention, all these subversive activities, must cease."
14,1959,URY,"With regard to the sharp conflicts which exist in some parts of the world and which are likely to spread, owing to their potential ramifications, Uruguay reiterates its unshakable faith and confidence in the principle it has always professed: that of peaceful solutions, through arbitration, mutual understanding and the intervention of appropriate jurisdictional bodies freely agreed upon."
14,1959,PAN,"Even in cases of flagrant aggression and the violation of the most elementary principles of international law, the legitimate principle of non-intervention in matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of States has been invoked in order to bar the way to lawful action by the United Nations."
14,1959,PAN,"The Republic of Panama maintains today, as it has always done, an unvarying position in defence of the principle of non-intervention in the internal or external affairs of any other State."
14,1959,PAN,"As I had the honour to state from this rostrum during the thirteenth session of the General Assembly [749th meeting], my country, which, as a small Power, cannot ignore the dangers arising from disregard of the principle of non-intervention, is ready to comply with its duty whenever there is any question of repelling an act or even a threat of intervention against any State, whether or not it is a Member of the United Nations."
14,1959,PAN,"The action with respect to threats to the peace, breaches of the peace and acts of aggression referred to in Chapter VII is thus the only form of intervention acceptable under the juridical system established in the Charter."
14,1959,PAN,"Such intervention on the part of regional organizations does not deprive the Security Council of the authority conferred on it by Article 34, which refers to the pacific settlement of international disputes, nor does it deprive the Members of the United Nations of their right, under Article 35, to bring to the attention of the Security Council or of the General Assembly, any situation likely to endanger international peace or security."
14,1959,CSK,"In the same way the peoples of the colonial and economically less-developed countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, despite the fact there are many differences between them, are all yearning for freedom and independence and repudiating imperialist intervention."
14,1959,CSK,In recent months Laos has been the principal object of increased imperialist intervention.

13,1958,KHM,"Either they will object on behalf of the principles of sovereignty and non-intervention; or they will feign obedience to the wishes of the United Nations and offer it the doubtful results of a prefabricated consultation, at the same time refusing to allow international observers to attend."
13,1958,KHM,"Although we may not be ready yet for world government, we ought to accept willingly the intervention, even if it is only the moral intervention, of an Assembly with wider and more universally respected powers in national cases which might cause international difficulties."

13,1958,DOM,Economic and social co-operation may not be used as an instrument of political penetration or of intervention in the affairs of States.
13,1958,DOM,"Just as at the conferences of Havana in 1928 , Montevideo in 1933 and Buenos Aires in 1936 , we succeeded in overcoming the dangerous indecision which was vitiating continental policy towards certain practices incompatible with the principles of the independence and sovereignty of States, and again reaffirmed the principle of non-intervention; and just as, at the conferences at Petropolis in 1947 and at Bogota in 1948, we established rules for collective security and the peaceful settlement of disputes which are an example to the rest of the world, it is now time for us to go beyond the stage of oratorical statements and of reservations inconsistent with the principles of economic and social co-operation which we claim to support, and to overcome the frustrations which attended the abortive Economic Agreement of Bogota, the meeting of Ministers of Finance in 1954 and the Economic Conference in Buenos Aires in 1947, in order to set up a vigorous and effective system of economic and social co-operation."

13,1958,ROU,The lack of any basis or consistency in the attempts made to justify the armed intervention by the United States in Lebanon and by the United Kingdom in Jordan has been demonstrated both by the debates during the third emergency special session and by the events that have taken place in those two Arab countries.
13,1958,ROU,"Although this argument is advanced as unanswerable, the whole world knows that it is only American intervention and the support given by the United States to its lackey Chiang Kai-shek which have prevented the reunification of the Chinese territory and the restoration of these islands to the People's Republic of China."
13,1958,ROU,"Denial of the right of peoples to organize their own life in accordance with their interests and aspirations, intervention by armed force in order to prevent them from enjoying their rights and to impose on them a subservient government — that is the essence of the doctrine underlying the activities of the United States in the Near East and in the Strait of Taiwan."
13,1958,ROU,"During the period that has elapsed since the third emergency special session, events in the Near East have shown once more that the reasons advanced by the United States and the United Kingdom to justify their military intervention are nothing but pretexts."
13,1958,ROU,"As regards the unceasing United States intervention in the Internal affairs of the Chinese people, and, in particular, the military measures taken recently and the provocation of the Chinese people by American militarists acting in league with their agent Chiang Kai-shek, the Romanian delegation wishes to stress the extremely dangerous nature of the situation brought about in the Taiwan Strait and the incalculable consequences which this may have."

13,1958,VEN,"Venezuela will apply scrupulously the principle of non-intervention, refraining from intervention in any form, because it is convinced that the strict maintenance of this principle is one of the main guarantees of international harmony."
13,1958,VEN,"I refer to both armed and ideological intervention, whether in the Internal or in the external affairs of States."
13,1958,VEN,Armed intervention is the very negation of a principle which is basic to our manner of thinking and way of life — a principle which has been embodied in our Constitution for more than a century: the principle of the peaceful settlement of international disputes.
13,1958,VEN,"These include: the supremacy of law, the principle of non-intervention, the peaceful settlement of disputes, mutual respect between members, and co-operation of all for the benefit of each and for the good of the community to which all members belong."
13,1958,HUN,"Secondly, the danger of war in the Middle East did not arise as a consequence of the revolution of the Iraqi people, but was created gradually by the State Department's policy of challenge through the military assistance given and the promise of American and British intervention made to its allies in Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq against the nationalist movements of the Arab peoples."
13,1958,HUN,"After the military intervention in the Middle East had been accomplished, the policy of challenge in the Far East was brought to a head in order to divert the attention of public opinion from United States and British troops stationed in the Middle East, in Lebanon and Jordan."
13,1958,HUN,"Lodge forgotten the United States intervention against the young Soviet State in 1918? And was it justice that, when the United States set up bases in Greenland and Iceland during the Second World War and undertook to liquidate these bases after the war, it then went back on its word?

13,1958,MEX,"We therefore reaffirm the validity of the principle of non-intervention, which protects the right of self-determination."
13,1958,MEX,"The Mexican Government, as shown by its delegation's active participation in that session, has been and continues to be deeply concerned that a just, equitable and mutually satisfactory solution should be found as soon as possible to the problems which for many years have beset the countries of the Middle East and which have caused so much suffering to the peoples of that area, Our interest, which is in keeping with Mexico's consistent policy of favouring the peaceful settlement of controversies and in support of the right of peoples to self-determination, is also based on its unswerving adherence to the principle of non-intervention, which we consider of fundamental importance in international relations."
13,1958,MEX,"However, for a complete and permanent return to normal in that area, upon the withdrawal of those troops, the Powers will have to show by their conduct, in accordance with the appeal made by the General Assembly at its third emergency special session, that they intend to act in strict conformity with the principle of non-intervention in their dealings with the Middle Eastern countries."

13,1958,IRN,"As we mentioned in our intervention at the third emergency special session of the General Assembly, we must tackle the problem? of the Middle East in the light of those underlying factors which have brought so much unrest and turmoil to the region; for the solution of the pressing ""surface"" issues alone cannot dispel the basic unrest from which the Middle East has suffered so grievously."

13,1958,IND,"It would assist the forces of peace, it would speed the pace of disarmament, it would give strength and substance to the Security Council and to the security provisions of the United Nations, My Government therefore pleads not for any intervention by the United Nations because I do not see how that is possible."
13,1958,RUS,"They can only be regarded as an attempt, on the part of those who suffered a political setback over their intervention in the Near East, to devise new, partly disguised ways of interfering in the affairs of the Arab countries and other States under cover of the United Nations."
13,1958,RUS,"Those who appraised soberly the situation which arose in the Near and Middle East as a result of United States and United Kingdom intervention and who said openly and unequivocally that those actions, no matter in what guise they were carried out, were the actions of enemies of peace, realized even at the time for what purpose the United States and the United Kingdom landed their troops in Lebanon and Jordan, along with tanks, aircraft, guns and warships."
13,1958,RUS,"We shall leave aside what was said by the United States and United Kingdom Governments in defence of their intervention in Lebanon and Jordan, including statements by their representatives at the special session of the General Assembly on that subject."

13,1958,UKR,"What record of ""achievements"" have the United States and Britain brought to this session of the General Assembly? The intervention in Lebanon and Jordan!

13,1958,UKR,"The Soviet Union has presented certain proposals for the establishment of a security system in Europe, it has called upon the United States to conclude a treaty of peace and friendship and prevent intervention in the internal affairs of the countries of the Near and Middle East, it has ceased its own nuclear tests unilaterally, and it has called upon the United States and Great Britain to do the same."
13,1958,UKR,As a powerful State the Soviet Union would like to base its relations with other States on principles of mutual respect and non-intervention in the internal affairs of others.

13,1958,PAN,"For Panama, as for all the republics of the American continent, the principle of non-intervention is sacrosanct."
13,1958,PAN,"From the earliest days of our independence, we have been conscious of the danger to our territorial integrity and our very existence constituted by the attempts at foreign intervention which wore a constant threat during the first few decades of our existence as free and sovereign States."
13,1958,PAN,"The period from the Congress of 1826 at Panama, which saw the birth of Bolivar's ideal of inter-American co-operation and solidarity, to the Charter of the Organization of American States, signed at Bogota in 1948, is the record of progress towards the final consecration of the principle of non-intervention."
13,1958,PAN,"At the Seventh International Conference of American States held in Montevideo in 1833, the Convention on Rights and Duties of States laid down the principle of non-intervention by one State in the internal or external affairs of another State."
13,1958,PAN,This denial of any claim to the right of intervention is categorical and allows of no exceptions.
13,1958,PAN,No plea of justification may be put forward nor may there be any intervention by force or by indirect means.
13,1958,PAN,"It should be noted that this position, one of scrupulous defence of the principle of non-intervention in any sphere of domestic policy, was already laid down in a significant manner in the Convention for the Promotion of Inter-American Cultural Relations, signed at the Inter-American Conference for the Maintenance of Peace, held at Buenos Aires in 1836."
13,1958,PAN,"The delegation of Panama is glad to note that the United Nations has strictly observed the principle of non-intervention as established in Article 2, paragraph 7, of the Charter."
13,1958,PAN,"In the same spirit that inspired the above- mentioned provisions of American international law, the United Nations has declared against any intervention in economic affairs."
13,1958,PAN,"We therefore consider that intervention constitutes an act of aggression, which may be direct or indirect according to its character and the means used, and that the only intervention which is legally justified is collective intervention as authorized by Chapter VII of the Charter, for the maintenance of international peace and security."
13,1958,PAN,"My country, as a small Power, cannot ignore the dangers arising from disregard of the principle of non-intervention."
13,1958,PAN,"In accordance with our traditions, I can affirm from this tribune that the Republic of Panama will not hesitate to comply with its duty to oppose any act or threat of intervention from wherever it may come, against any State, whether or not it is a Member of the United Nations."
13,1958,PAN,"I venture to say, with the deepest conviction; that the use of such a police force, once it has been set up, with the wisdom and prudence so far shown by this Organization, will never give grounds for believing that we are exceeding our powers and still less that we are guilty of improper intervention."
13,1958,POL,But there is only one possible solution to that problem — the United States must put a stop to its armed intervention in the internal affairs of China and cease fanning the flames of civil war on that front.

13,1958,BLR,"Everyone knows that were it not for American intervention, the islands of the Taiwan region would long since have rejoined the People's Republic of China."
13,1958,BLR,To put an end to that conflict it is essential that United States intervention in the domestic affairs of the People's Republic of China should cease and that the United States Government should instruct its armed forces in the Taiwan region to desist from military intervention in that conflict and let the Chinese decide their own domestic affairs.
13,1958,BLR,The Government of the People's Republic of China demands quite legitimately that the United States should and its intervention in China's domestic affairs and withdraw its fleet from the Taiwan Strait and that United States soldiers should leave Taiwan and go home to America.
13,1958,ITA,"The principle of social welfare has been taken almost everywhere as the basis for intervention on the part of a government to a point where the entire economy is no longer conceived as a simple means of enrichment but as a means of strengthening, increasing and distributing wealth."
13,1958,SAU,"In spite of the recent arms shipment provided by certain Western Powers, Israel is not going to stay, and the reason is simple; it is not a question of action by the Arab States but, rather, action within Israel, Israel is undoing Israel; and here is where United Nations intervention is called for."
13,1958,BGR,"With regard to the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan, we would point out that there are powerful factors with which the aggressors must reckon: world public opinion, which is backed by the effective strength of the peace-loving States and which condemned the unjustifiable intervention against two small Arab States, and resolution 1237 (ES-III) which was unanimously adopted on the subject by the General Assembly, at its third emergency special session."
13,1958,BGR,"While it is true that the intervention of the United States and the United Kingdom in Lebanon and Jordan has most directly affected the Arab countries, it is also true that the interests of all peoples fully Coincide with those of the Arab peoples, which are fighting to do away with the remnants of colonialism and to prevent interference by imperialist Powers in their domestic affairs."
13,1958,BGR,"During that period, all the so-called arguments originally advanced to justify the intervention of the United States and the United Kingdom have collapsed."
13,1958,CSK,"The leading part in this is being played by the aggressive circles of the United States which are seeking to achieve world domination and to arrest the course of human progress by their ""position of strength"" and ""brink of war"" policy, and by the organization of subversive activity and armed intervention."

13,1958,CSK,"World attention is still focused on the dangerous situation in the Near and Middle East, a situation which has arisen as a result of armed intervention by the United States in Lebanon and by the United Kingdom in Jordan."
13,1958,CSK,We cannot allow intervention in the domestic affairs of other countries to continue in future under cover of the United Nations.
13,1958,CSK,"How is it possible to talk about the need to abide by the principles of equality and mutual respect within the United Nations and simultaneously, in the same breath, to commit aggressive acts against sovereign States, as is being done in the Taiwan Strait and as was done in the case of the armed intervention in Lebanon and the organization of subversive activities in the Hungarian People's Republic? 144."

13,1958,CSK,"The basic reason for this unsatisfactory state of affairs is that the circles which are eager for war have not abandoned their ""position of strength"" policy, the policy of forming military blocs, and have not renounced armed intervention and interference."
13,1958,CSK,"In its speech in the general debate on 24 September 1958 [756th meeting], the Czechoslovak delegation emphasized the serious nature of the situation brought about by American-British intervention in Lebanon and Jordan."
13,1958,CSK,"The true cause of the threat to peace and the tension in the Near and Middle East, relaxation of which the United States and Britain supposedly desire, is the continued intervention by these countries in Arab affairs."
13,1958,CSK,"There will be a real relaxation of tension in the Near and Middle East and an improvement in the situation only when the Western Powers renounce their policy of intervention in the internal affairs of the Arab countries and of inciting one Arab State against another, when they withdraw their Interventionist forces from the territory of those countries."

13,1958,CSK,"The peoples of the Arab countries, with whose just struggle against the colonialists for freedom and independence we sympathize, have the right to settle their own affairs by themselves without any outside intervention."
13,1958,CSK,"If the United Nations intends to carry out the mission for which it was instituted, it must rise to the defence of the Arab peoples and take a resolute stand against the continuing intervention and interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries; it must call for the immediate withdrawal of the United States and British interventionist forces from Lee on and Jordan."

46,1991,PAN,"I am not upholding a false concept of the principle of non intervention, for sovereignty is founded on the self-determination of a people, not that of any Government."
46,1991,DNK,"It is a paradox of international law that, on one hand, a customary rule may have evolved, permitting a State to intervene outside its own territory through rescue missions vis-à-vis their own nationals if they are exposed to grave dangers, whereas, on the other hand, it is still not legitimate to use armed intervention to rescue thousands of innocent persons whose lives are in danger because of their own government's repressive policies."

How can it fail to protest when its financial negotiations are sabotaged, when public Panamanian funds, which have been withheld, are dealt with in a piratical manner without precedent in history, and in particular when every day may be the eve of a military attack from those United States bases located in our own territory?

65,2010,JAM,"Jamaica has adopted a multifaceted approach to  tackle crime and violence, relying not only on law  enforcement but on strategic social intervention and  social transformation initiatives to create new  opportunities and inspire hope, especially among our  young people, who are vulnerable to being recruited or  conscripted into criminal enterprises."
65,2010,GNB,"The main target is the very men  and women who 40 years ago bartered their youth and  education — in other words, their future — for our  national liberation: the same armed forces who were  then so applauded and admired for their determination  and courage in forging the freedom and independence  of the peoples of Guinea and Cape Verde, as well as for  their intervention in other theatres of war, following  their international vocation."
09,1954,PHL,"It has been said that the plan for the so-called defence of South-East Asia is built on the notion of enlisting some Asian countries in a scheme to carry out armed intervention, and that it was aimed at hiding the special interests of the colonizers."
09,1954,POL,"It consists in recognizing the need for coexistence and establishing relations upon the basis of co-operation, non-intervention in domestic affairs, respect for mutual interests and peaceful competition."
09,1954,ISR,"Three years ago, the Security Council [558th meeting] called upon Egypt to terminate all restrictions upon international commercial shipping in the Suez Canal, wherever bound, and rejected the doctrine of belligerent rights on which Egypt based its discriminatory restrictions and active intervention against shipping bound to or from Israel."
09,1954,UKR,"This fact alone shows that the real aims of the Manila Treaty have nothing in common with the true interests of the Asian peoples and with the principles on which international co-operation should be based: the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, non-intervention in the domestic affairs of States, equal rights, mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence."
09,1954,UKR,"The official United States Press describes the Manila Treaty as the first official instrument of our time designed to permit international intervention in the domestic affairs of States, intervention which, moreover, can take any form, from economic and military aid to direct intervention."
09,1954,CRI,"We would never attempt unilaterally to change the course chosen by other nations; we consider ourselves good Latin Americans, and as such regard the principle of non-intervention as one of the basic principles of international life."
09,1954,YUG,Such an association of necessity conceals or generates tendencies towards intervention and admits the use of force as an instrument of political action.
09,1954,CAN,"Here, as I see it, the primary object of our world Organization must be prevention, rather than intervention."
09,1954,ECU,My Government considers that the political system and internal structure of a State are by contrast with some other matters I have mentioned — questions exclusively within its domestic jurisdiction in which no intervention by a foreign Power should be tolerated.
09,1954,COL,"An organization of this kind easily tends to become a new state-like entity, a super-government with powers greater than those conferred by its constitution, and it must not be forgotten that such an arbitrary assumption of power has repercussions which could culminate in the extinction of the international body, with all the consequences attendant on such a failure, nor must we forget that because of this inordinate assumption of powers we have to witness a struggle for control of the organization which, with its extended powers, might be an effective instrument of intervention or of peaceful penetration."
09,1954,ARG,"In short, the less local a dispute and the more obvious it is that enforcement action may be needed, the more necessary is the intervention of the Security Council, which has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security."
09,1954,ARG,"These moral forces are deeply rooted in our history and are based on the recognition of the self-determination of peoples, the juridical equality of States and an ethical international policy, the main feature of which is the obligation to refrain from direct or indirect intervention in the domestic affairs of other countries; they are the expression of Argentina’s unswerving purpose, reaffirmed by President Peron on memorable occasions, of living in peace with all nations."
09,1954,RUS,These principles are: (a)mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty; (b) non-aggression; (c) non-intervention in each other’s internal affairs; (d) equality and mutual advantage; (e) peaceful coexistence.
09,1954,RUS,"The real intention underlying the plan for the so-called defence of South-East Asia is to undertake armed intervention in Asia with the help of some Asian countries, intervention on a “collective basis”, to use the term coined by some of the leading proponents of the plan."
09,1954,RUS,"The plan is similar to the plan for the Korean war, involving the organization of foreign intervention with the participation of a few unimportant Asian countries in order to conceal the special interest of the colonists in dominating and in continuing to dominate the area it is a plan to suppress the national-liberation movement in the South-East Asian countries by means of a perfidious scheme to set one group of Asian peoples against another."
09,1954,RUS,"Such intervention, he went on to say, had developed into actual intervention in “the political affairs of foreign States."
09,1954,NLD,"The United Nations would be better advised to concentrate on those fields where it is indispensable, rather than to take up, time and again, matters which cannot be solved and whose ends are frequently not served by international intervention."
09,1954,IRQ,We certainly appreciate the United Nations intervention in Korea to check aggression.
09,1954,CHL,We are told of the boundless importance of private enterprise and the danger of economic intervention by the State.
09,1954,CHL,Exaggerated fear of economic intervention by the State evidences ignorance of the real situation.
09,1954,CHN,The concept of co-existence suggests a mutual regard for each other’s boundaries and non-intervention on each other’s internal affairs.
09,1954,CHN,"But the attack from within as I have described it, does not need, in its operation, to violate any physical boundary or to give the appearance of intervention."
03,1948,FRA,The French delegation warmly welcomed the success of its intervention in establishing a truce.
03,1948,PER,"Non-intervention was a principle of public law, enshrined in the fundamental documents of Pan-American history, which had enabled the American peoples to create a vigorous system, gradually strengthened stage by stage, in which the freedom of the States and international solidarity were interwoven."
03,1948,PER,"The principle of non-intervention was specially designed to safeguard the sovereignty and independence of small States, and was subject only to the collective action envisaged in the San Francisco Charter for safeguarding international peace when it was threatened or broken."
03,1948,BLR,"He had obviously distorted a speech of Lenin made in 1918, at a time when the young Soviet Republic was repelling the attacks of British and other foreign armies of intervention."
03,1948,CHL,"As a consistent defender of human rights, Chile had denounced in the Security Council the intervention of a foreign Power in the internal affairs of a neighbouring country (S/69 6)."
03,1948,ZAF,"It was not unmindful of the fact there were some items on the credit side of the United Nations account, both as regards intervention in certain international disputes and in the humanitarian sphere."
03,1948,URY,"For that reason, it would be desirable to grant the International Court of Justice — within the limits of the competence granted by its Statute — wider powers of intervention both in its purely judicial functions and in its consultative ones; in the latter respect its conclusions should be firmly supported, account being taken of them in any ulterior decision."
03,1948,DOM,"When those problems came under discussion, the Dominican Republic would not fall into the contradiction characterizing the attitude of those countries which were strong protagonists of the principle of non-intervention when their own interests were involved or the interests of supporting ideological regimes but which were opposed to the same fundamental principle — the essential basis of relationships between States — when the Governments of countries of a different ideology were involved."
03,1948,UKR,"The policy of interference in the internal affairs of other countries, which was reflected either in open military intervention as in Greece, or as in Italy in pressure upon elections with a view to creating in foreign countries such governments as might be acceptable to foreign Powers if not to the peoples of the countries concerned, did not help the cause of peace and international co-operation."
03,1948,CSK,"The reasons were quite simple; their illustration could be clearly seen in any one of many concrete cases, for example, in the case of Greece, where, through the open and undisguised intervention in the interned affairs of the country first on the part of the United Kingdom and subsequently on the part of the United States of America — a tragic situation had been created which was obviously in flagrant conflict with the obligations imposed by the Charter."
03,1948,POL,The Polish delegation was still of the opinion that foreign troops should be withdrawn from Greece and that outside intervention should cease completely.
03,1948,POL,It had done so because it refused to support in any way the intervention policy dictated by interests other than those of Greece.
03,1948,POL,The Polish delegation maintained its view that only the withdrawal of British forces and the end of American intervention could restore peace in Greece.
03,1948,PAK,"As one representative had remarked in the course of the recent discussions in the Security Council, Italy had sought to justify its intervention in Abyssinia on similar grounds of a humanitarian and civilizing character."
03,1948,YUG,"Together with the representatives of the USSR and of the other peoples’ democracies the representatives of Yugoslavia had constantly pointed out that the real causes of the national rising in Greece were to be sought not in alleged intervention or instigation by Greece’s northern neighbours but, on the one hand, in the undemocratic establishment of a Government to which the majority of the Greek people was hostile and, on the other hand, in the crude interference of the United States of America and of the United Kingdom in the internal affairs of Greece, as a result of which the overwhelming majority of the Greek people was unable to express its will."
03,1948,YUG,"Hence the cessation of that intervention and the withdrawal of foreign troops, missions and so-called experts from Greece would be the first step towards the only correct solution of the Greek problem in the spirit of the United Nations Charter, which condemned interference in the internal affairs of other States."
03,1948,YUG,"Another road had been taken, however; namely, the intensification of foreign intervention in Greece and of attributing responsibility for conditions in that country to Greece’s northern neighbours."
03,1948,YUG,"The assertion that only a small minority was in revolt in Greece, with the encouragement of the northern countries, was almost entirely untrue as increased foreign intervention obviously resulted in increased resistance on the part of the people, since nations did not gladly suffer the presence of armed missionaries from abroad."
03,1948,YUG,The present conflagration in Greece was the consequence of and the answer to the foreign intervention begun by Mr.
03,1948,YUG,"That intervention had already suffered one setback, but had later been taken over by the United States of America."
03,1948,YUG,"Today it could be shown by concrete facts that the Special Committee on the Balkans, far from helping to solve the so-called Greek question in a democratic sense and in the interests of peace, had aggravated the situation in Greece by its unlimited support of monarcho-fascist elements and of intervention by the United States and the United Kingdom."
03,1948,YUG,"The prolonged foreign intervention, to which the representative of the Byelorussian SSR had referred at the 147th plenary meeting provided direct confirmation of the accuracy of Lenin’s view."
32,1977,TCD,"My country remains deeply dedicated to the sacred principles of the Charter; in particular the principles of non-intervention in the internal and external affairs of other States; strict respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every State; non-recourse to force in international relations, and the peaceful settlement of disputes through negotiation, mediation, conciliation or arbitration."
32,1977,BRA,"It presupposes, therefore, respect for the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of States which, more than a general principle of the United Nations, is a legal obligation assumed by all States upon signing and ratifying the Charter."
32,1977,BRA,"Non-intervention in the internal and external affairs of other States and attachment to peaceful and effective means for the solution of occasional disputes, which stem very often from the very closeness of their relationship, constitute the incalculable heritage of the countries of that region."
32,1977,PAN,"This new type of hemispheric relations can only prosper harmoniously, however, by complete compliance with the principles which are deeply rooted in the conscience of the peoples of this region and today enshrined in contemporary international law, such as respect for the territorial integrity and the independence of States, non-intervention by a State in the internal affairs of another State, self-determination of peoples, the peaceful settlement of disputes, the renunciation of the use or threat of force, the sovereign equality of States, and the application of fundamental human rights."
32,1977,PAN,"There are some who, with repeated obstinacy, seek to confuse the concept of the neutrality and the defence of the inter-oceanic way with that of intervention; but intervention has become a dirty word to the Latin American peoples who have suffered and have learned hard lessons from history."
32,1977,PAN,It may be said that the provision of international law which is most deeply rooted in the thoughts and feelings of the Latin American peoples is the principle of non-intervention.
32,1977,PAN,"This has been the basis of relations between the United States and Latin America since in Montevideo in 1933 and Buenos Aires in 1936 the great North American Power renounced the principle of intervention by subscribing to the Declaration of the nations of the hemisphere, to the effect that direct or indirect intervention in internal or external affairs is inadmissible."
32,1977,ARE,We have always called and will continue to call for the solution of existing or future disputes among States of our region by peaceful means and without any foreign intervention.
32,1977,GRC,I would not like to conclude my intervention without referring to two major issues: the new economic order and the question of human rights.
32,1977,EGY,"First, foreign intervention, instead of disappearing with the ebb of colonialism, is reappearing under various pretexts again in Africa, though disguised in other forms."
32,1977,EGY,"The fact still remains that all foreign intervention in Africa is unacceptable, for it goes against the interest of the peoples and can only lead to an escalation of conflict and factionalism as well as to the creation of new areas of tension."
32,1977,URY,Uruguay accordingly proposed the establishment of a truly international legal body which would advise on all cases of violations of human rights and would set up a consultative mechanism to prevent unlawful interference or intervention.
32,1977,URY,"On that point, I would like to state that Uruguay was forced to carry out a hard struggle against subversion and foreign intervention without the slightest support from even the traditional allies of the free world."
32,1977,BHR,"The Organization has made commendable efforts to preserve world peace and security, and has been able, by its timely intervention, to contain some local disputes and prevent them from deteriorating into global destructive wars."
32,1977,BHR,"The regrettable events in the Middle East are no more than a result of the tension prevailing in the area, which Israel exploits in order to pursue, openly or secretly, its aggressive policy and its intervention in the affairs of the neighbouring Arab countries."
32,1977,NGA,"Examples of foreign intervention at present exist in large numbers in that easily destabilized continent, and I need not mention any specific cases here."
32,1977,MEX,"On the international scene, Mexico has always endorsed certain basic principles which are the result of its history: non-intervention of one State in the domestic affairs of another; the self-determination of peoples; the pacific settlement of disputes, with its complement, the abstention from the threat or use of force; and the sovereign equality of States."
32,1977,CHL,"Due process means the intervention of a body which in its origin and action would be independent of political interests, would have come into being prior to the trial, would have universal competence and, at the same time, would have a pre-established procedure that would ensure the impartiality of the international inquiry, the certainty of the proof and a real possibility for the nation accused to defend itself."
32,1977,KHM,"The peoples of the countries in that region are resolutely opposed to all forms of foreign interference and intervention, so that their countries may live in genuine independence and sovereignty."
32,1977,KHM,"The United States of America should immediately withdraw from South Korea all its land, naval and air forces and all its military materiel, including nuclear weapons; it should cease its interference and intervention in and its aggression against Korea, abandon its policy of ""two Koreas"", dissolve the so-called ""United Nations Command"" and transform the ""Armistice Agreement"" into a definitive peace agreement."
32,1977,KHM,"Secondly, the United States of America continues its interference and intervention in the internal affairs of China."
32,1977,KHM,"This struggle is an integral part of the struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism and expansionism, and against all acts of exploitation, oppression, interference and intervention."
32,1977,CUB,"Furthermore, the intervention of Israeli military forces in southern Lebanon constitutes an aggression against that independent State and a new cause of disturbance."
32,1977,CUB,"It is important to recall that that is one of the zones in the world where a great number of acts of aggression and intervention in the internal affairs of States were committed, where plans were hatched to assassinate Heads of Government and where territories were occupied in defiance of the will of the peoples by North American imperialism and its institutions and, in particular, by the CIA."
32,1977,MDG,"New forms of intervention have been devised to undermine the security of certain States, the political options of which cannot and could never coincide with those of the imperialist, capitalist and neo-colonial interests."
32,1977,BRB,"While Barbados does not subscribe to the view that the question of human rights should be hypocritically or mischievously used as a propaganda tool, it cannot regard as a breach of the principle of non-intervention all comments on and condemnation of violations of civil, political or other rights in places beyond one's own boundaries."
32,1977,OMN,My country's absolute belief that peace and security for the whole of the international community are inextricably linked causes it to view with grave concern the dangerous intervention of external Powers in the internal affairs of the peoples of the African continent.
32,1977,OMN,"Occurring after the long and bitter struggle for independence by the African peoples, this foreign intervention aggravates the problems of this continent and dims its countries' prospects for that genuine peace which Africa and-the international community are seeking, especially after the long sufferings endured by those countries in their struggle for independence."
32,1977,OMN,"We see in this foreign intervention nothing but a blow to the hopes and aspirations of the African peoples in their pursuit of a free and peaceful life in accordance with a system of free choice and self-determination, free of any foreign interference."
32,1977,OMN,"The aim of this foreign intervention is also the destruction of existing efforts to find solutions to the urgent problems of the African continent, solutions which will lead to security, stability and the development of the economic capabilities of the African peoples."
32,1977,BLR,"By building upon what has already been achieved, and by making efforts to achieve the universal participation of States in the multilateral treaties and agreements now in force and their implementation in good faith, the United Nations can set itself such goals and settle such problems as the prevention of the danger of nuclear war, the containment of the arms race, disarmament, the elimination of conflict situations and of the vestiges of colonialism and racism, the deepening and expansion of international co-operation on the basis of the non-use of force in international relations, equality, non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States, and the strengthening of the feelings of friendship, co-operation and mutual trust among all peoples."
32,1977,LKA,"This turmoil is not just the outcome of local dissension amongst the countries of Africa, but rather the consequence of interest, if not intervention, on the part of outside Powers."
32,1977,LKA,"On the one hand, host countries have always entertained fears about intervention, through the arbitration of an international body, on matters concerning national sovereignty."
32,1977,MMR,The situation in Namibia and Zimbabwe is in a critical phase and is dangerously fraught with the risk of civil war and outside intervention.
32,1977,ALB,"The interests of the peoples call for a courageous and determined struggle to strengthen independence and sovereignty against political, ideological, economic and military aggression, against imperialist intrigues and intervention."
32,1977,HND,"We proclaim our belief in the peaceful settlement of international disputes, in non-intervention, in international co-operation, in the permanent and full sovereignty of each State over its natural resources."
32,1977,BEL,The nine countries strongly reject any intervention by any State which seeks to establish a zone of influence on the African continent.
32,1977,BEL,Recent painful events in the Horn of Africa underline the importance of this principle of non-intervention.
32,1977,GTM,"Unilateral actions or pressures, however worthy their motives, can always be considered as forms of intervention which are prohibited in relations among States."
32,1977,GTM,"We reiterate our support for United Nations principles, particularly those which are vital for the harmonious existence of nations, such as sovereignty, territorial integrity, non-intervention, compliance in good faith with international obligations, the promotion of international social justice and international co-operation for development."
32,1977,LAO,"Faced with this situation, the imperialists have reacted in a variety of pernicious ways, resorting to fallacious propaganda, to division, to the policy of peaceful evolution and to tactics of intimidation, intervention and aggression aimed at checking the revolution and impeding progress."
32,1977,LAO,"Asia we steadily pursue the policy of developing friendly relations and co-operation of various kinds with the countries of the region on the basis of mutual respect for independence and sovereignty, territorial integrity, equality and mutual advantage, and of not allowing any foreign country to use one's territory as a base for aggression and direct or indirect intervention directed against another country."
32,1977,LAO,"We support the peoples of South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia in their struggle against racism and apartheid, against imperialist interference and aggression, for national independence, against oppression and exploitation, and for democracy and social progress; and we strongly condemn all the bloody and savage acts of the racist regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia, and imperialist intervention and aggression."
32,1977,NIC,"Once more we have seen the direct effects of foreign intervention, which render the solution of conflicts more difficult because it introduces elements which do take account not of the interests of the countries primarily involved but rather of the neo-colonialist strategies and long-term interests of the countries that carry out the intervention."
32,1977,NIC,"That will, however, be difficult if foreign intervention persists."
32,1977,NIC,We once again energetically condemn intervention as contrary to the principles that should govern relations among peoples.
32,1977,NIC,"However, the fact that some States claim that they strictly and fully observe human rights does not entitle them to set themselves up as judges of other countries, arrogating to themselves a function which nobody has conferred on them and which is contrary to the principles of non-intervention and of the legal equality of States."
32,1977,TUR,The events precipitated by the Greek military intervention in 1974 have inevitably produced a regrouping of the two communities.
32,1977,SOM,I hope that my intervention has provided the General Assembly with the necessary information enabling a clear understanding of the present situation in the Horn of Africa and of the historical developments that have led to that situation.
32,1977,AGO,"No one in this Assembly can or should be unaware that the growing contradiction between the capitalist camp and the socialist camp has shifted the scene of military confrontation from South-East Asia to the African continent, where, as a result of the resounding defeat of North American imperialism in Viet Nam and the collapse of the Portuguese colonial empire, an offensive is being mounted by certain imperialist Powers in the form of indirect intervention, the immediate effect of which is the destabilization of progressive African regimes."
32,1977,YMD,"Moreover, the expansionist ambitions of certain States, and their military intervention in the affairs of others, pose no less a threat to the peace of the area."
32,1977,SLV,"There is no doubt that that would be tantamount to intervention, and, although it might be done for humanitarian reasons, it would none the less be intolerable."
32,1977,PRT,"Besides, the continued deterioration of the conflict may render the intervention of outside forces unavoidable."
32,1977,PRT,"It should not be forgotten that this action was prompted by solidarity, and sometimes by political interests which were not always directly related to the degree of justice or injustice prevailing in each colonial situation; but unquestionably, in my mind, these situations constituted a field in which the intervention of the United Nations was morally just, legally in accordance with the aims of the Charter, and politically viable."
55,2000,BRB,One of the most complex issues currently being debated in the context of an enhanced role for the international community in the maintenance of international peace and security is the clash between the opposing tenets of sovereignty and humanitarian intervention.
55,2000,BRB,"Humanitarian intervention, however compelling the circumstances, must never be used as a guise for unwarranted interference in internal State governance."
55,2000,JAM,This has meant seeking a delicate balance between respect for sovereignty and the urgent need for humanitarian intervention.
55,2000,JAM,Humanitarian intervention in such cases is imperative.
55,2000,JAM,"And we must not forget the importance of adequately equipping the United Nations machinery to ensure robust intervention at every stage of the peacekeeping process, particularly for rapid deployment when necessary."
55,2000,LCA,"Unless these inequities and imbalances are corrected, we will continue to create situations of unrest and threaten intervention while causes go unaddressed."
55,2000,ALB,"The current situation in Kosovo contradicts the sceptical and nihilistic opinions, expressed here and there, against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military intervention in Kosovo and against the establishment of the United Nations administration there."
55,2000,PER,"May I emphasize, in particular, the rights that refer to the sovereignty of States, to non-intervention in their domestic affairs and to the legal equality between States."
55,2000,LBY,"As we reiterate today our invitation to all States to help Africa in developing a programme to eliminate epidemics and diseases, provide a solution to the problem of its external debt and ensure that the continent is dealt with on new, just and equitable terms, rather than be considered merely as a consumer market for the products of the industrialized world, we wish to recall, as we have always done, that Africa's problems lie in the abuse of its resources, the plundering of its wealth and riches, intervention in its internal affairs and the imposition of foreign concepts alien to its traditions and culture."
55,2000,AUS,"First, military intervention must be used only as a last resort."
55,2000,ESP,"In this overall context, we must mention the issue of so-called humanitarian intervention, aptly proposed on more than one occasion by the Secretary-General."
55,2000,ZWE,The responsive intervention of the SADC allies effectively contained the situation and established the relative calm and stability prevailing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo today.
55,2000,NAM,"In such a kinder and inclusive world that we wish to live in, a dreadful notion of humanitarian intervention, by whatever name, does not fit in."
55,2000,NAM,Namibia remains unconvinced and will continue to oppose any form of unilateral humanitarian intervention outside the Charter.
55,2000,NAM,The South is incapable of initiating any humanitarian intervention in the North.
55,2000,NAM,"Can Kuwait, Cyprus, Saint Lucia or Namibia really dare launch any humanitarian intervention anywhere in the world? They just cannot."
55,2000,NAM,"Quite simply, in a world of lopsided military might, humanitarian intervention is yet another code-name for colonization."
55,2000,DJI,"Somalia as a nation, as an entity, seemed condemned to a slow death, unable to expect either regional or international intervention or a positive change in the behaviour of the warlords."
55,2000,PLW,An integrated approach to intervention in the field of HIV/AIDS is critically called for in many developing countries.
55,2000,SVN,It is also imperative for the United Nations to elaborate a doctrine for humanitarian intervention based on a modern interpretation of the Charter and in line with new international relations and norms.
55,2000,SVN,We listened with interest to the statements made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada in this Hall on the establishment of an independent international commission on intervention and State sovereignty.
55,2000,EGY,"After the end of the cold war and the end of tensions between the two super-Powers, international peace became exposed to a new kind of threat, the threat resulting from the disintegration of some States, the collapse of their national structures and the victimization of their people due to internal strife and negative foreign intervention."
55,2000,EGY,"New ideas, such as humanitarian intervention and the preventive deployment of forces, have, since the last session, begun to gain currency."
55,2000,CUB,"The emergence of a unipolar world in which a single super-Power is capable of militarily controlling the international scene, far from meaning greater security for our peoples, has ushered in a new stage in which the hegemonism of that sole super-Power prevails — direct or covert interventionism under the guise of multilateral actions, insecurity for the small countries, selfishness as a behavioural pattern in international relations and the attempt to disregard the principles of equality among States, national sovereignty, self- determination, non-intervention, the non-threat or the use of force and the settlement of disputes through peaceful means — principles that have constituted the cornerstone of the United Nations."
55,2000,CUB,The attempts at imposing by force and under pressure the so-called right of humanitarian intervention are at present the greatest threat to international peace and security.
55,2000,FRA,"In addition to its military resources, it will develop civilian intervention capabilities, including a corps of civilian police, whose contribution to peacekeeping is invaluable."
55,2000,QAT,True democracy is one that is freely chosen by any people for its mode of governance without outside intervention.
55,2000,NRU,"The President of the Republic of Nauru, in his intervention in the round-table discussion, expressed his disappointment that the core responsibilities of the United Nations regarding the rights of peoples to self- determination and freedom from alien domination did not rank as importantly as the other issues currently before us."
55,2000,NRU,"Our head of State stated Nauru's position on the issue in his intervention at the Millennium Summit, and I will therefore not repeat it here."
55,2000,NRU,This is wrong in international law and violates both the letter and spirit of many United Nations resolutions regarding the intervention of international organizations in the domestic jurisdiction of States.
55,2000,SLV,We want to make it quite clear that our support for this initiative is not intended as an intervention in the internal affairs of another Member State.
55,2000,AFG,Pakistani military intervention in Afghanistan is a fact well known to the international community.
55,2000,AFG,This would break the silence that has thus far encouraged further Pakistani intervention in Afghanistan.
55,2000,AFG,"The Islamic State of Afghanistan has high expectations that the United Nations and the international community will exert pressure on Pakistan to immediately cease its intervention in Afghanistan and to withdraw all its military personnel and armed nationals from Afghanistan; that the Security Council will address the question of foreign 7 intervention, the existence of terrorist networks in Afghanistan and the effective implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions; that the Organization of the Islamic Conference will clarify its view of the Taliban's words and deeds — spoken and carried out in the name of Islam — which we believe distort, and are contrary to, the true spirit of Islam, its tenets and injunctions; that the United Nations Drug Control Programme will assist the Islamic State of Afghanistan in the fight against the production and trafficking of illicit drugs; that the United Nations and the international community will step up their efforts for an early and peaceful settlement of the Afghan conflict; and that the international community will provide humanitarian assistance to the war-stricken and drought-hit civilian population of Afghanistan."
55,2000,MMR,"Sovereignty, sovereign equality, respect for territorial integrity and non-intervention in internal affairs are cardinal principles that remain vital for the peace and security of all nations."
55,2000,CHN,"At the same time, we must not fail to see the complexity of international intervention and the danger of inappropriate intervention."
55,2000,CHN,The United Nations intervention should 7  aim at eliminating the root causes of a given conflict rather than delaying its settlement.
55,2000,TKM,"The model of political globalization based on the supremacy of a neo-liberal philosophy is gradually strengthening the logic of confrontational thought in international affairs, leading to the arm-twisting of those who don't recognize the new international power structure based on humanitarian intervention and protecting human rights, but not on the rights of peoples."
55,2000,POL,That would also have enabled us to avoid last year's arguments and controversies over the issue of humanitarian intervention.
55,2000,MLI,"As the report rightly emphasizes, United Nations intervention must be decided upon on the basis of uniform criteria, regardless of the region in which conflicts occur."
55,2000,NGA,"We are talking of dialogue that takes the issues on board in a holistic manner, as opposed to the current practice of abstracting merely one or other manifestation of the system — for example, in the case of wars of attrition and the idea of international humanitarian intervention."
55,2000,NGA,The debate so far has brought to the fore the problem of the contradiction between sovereignty and intervention.
55,2000,NGA,"Of course, nation States, even those on the verge of evaporation, would be sensitive to the word “intervention”."
55,2000,NGA,? What about the situation that arises when sanctions lead to deaths on a serious scale? All these should find a place in a proper and systematic discussion of humanitarian intervention aimed at giving succour to those who may be trapped in tragedies other than wars.
55,2000,DOM,"Thus, when there is talk of also enshrining humanitarian intervention as a right, we find ourselves faced with a situation that demands clear-cut and precise definitions."
55,2000,MAR,That is why we support all the initiatives that have been recommended by the United Nations to set up a strategy to prevent conflicts and to improve mechanisms for intervention in these cases.
55,2000,GEO,"The dilemma of humanitarian intervention could be described as being inherent to the transition from an international to a global — and, hence, more human- centred — world."
55,2000,GEO,"Therefore, we are confident that the international community should focus on establishing within this Organization strong and efficient preventive mechanisms, mechanisms to prevent gross and systematic violations of human rights, in order to reduce the likelihood of “humanitarian intervention”, an extreme measure."
55,2000,GEO,"The dilemma of “humanitarian intervention” is also directly related to United Nations reform, in regard to adapting the existing decision-making mechanism to the timely and effective use of force."
55,2000,PRK,The most serious challenge posed in international relations at present is the emergence of the concept of “humanitarian intervention”.
55,2000,PRK,“Humanitarian intervention” is a dangerous concept that could beautify such acts of high-handedness and eliminate the essential spirit of the Charter.
55,2000,PRK,"International peace and security should be achieved by strengthening the role of the United Nations, not by arbitrariness, high-handedness and intervention by any individual big Power."
55,2000,NLD,"In such a vision, the principle of non- intervention yields to the defence of human rights; sovereignty is further reappraised; there is room for civil society and the private sector; and economics are also held responsible for social and development goals."
55,2000,URY,"In any event, we warmly welcome the initiatives aimed at a more in-depth consideration of what has been termed “humanitarian intervention”."
55,2000,TUR,"Therefore, it would be a gross distortion of history to consider Turkish intervention as an occupation."
55,2000,TUR,"Due to Turkish intervention, not only did the coup in Cyprus fail, but also the junta collapsed, and democracy returned to Greece."
55,2000,CHL,"From the ethical standpoint of our common humanity, we have viewed with interest the development of the concept of humanitarian intervention."
55,2000,CHL,Chile continues to abide by the principles of non-intervention and the self-determination of peoples.
55,2000,DZA,It is in the context of this vision that we state our position on humanitarian intervention.
55,2000,DNK,Any intervention reflects a failure of prevention.
55,2000,DNK,"The challenge is to keep open the option of humanitarian intervention without Security Council authorization in extreme cases, but to do so without jeopardizing the international legal order."
55,2000,CAN,"Of course, prevention is the best form of intervention."
55,2000,CAN,"The question of intervention in these instances, including, as a last resort, the use of military force, is fraught with difficulty and controversy."
55,2000,CAN,"Nothing so threatens the United Nations very future as this apparent contradiction between principle and power; between people's security and Governments' interests; between, in short, humanitarian intervention and State sovereignty."
55,2000,CAN,Canada has responded by creating an independent international commission on intervention and State sovereignty.
55,2000,CAN,"It is Canada's hope that this new commission can diffuse the anxiety that surrounds 4  the issues of intervention and sovereignty by building a similar bridge between our current notions of these concepts, and in so doing help to define the way ahead for Governments and the United Nations to tackle the most challenging international dilemma of the twenty- first century."
55,2000,ARG,My country believes that the principle of non-intervention must be duly respected because it is the pillar underpinning relations between independent States.
55,2000,ROU,We are ready to participate in a profound and responsible debate on humanitarian intervention.
55,2000,RUS,"Disregard for these principles and military intervention circumventing the Security Council, whatever humanitarian pretexts may be used, undermine the very foundations of the world order and pave the way for arbitrariness in international affairs."
55,2000,TUN,"Along the same lines, with respect to the role of the Security Council, we cannot overlook the question of humanitarian intervention, which has been the subject of widening debate in recent years and whose review calls for particular and sustained attention."
55,2000,TUN,"Indeed, if a particular humanitarian situation requires urgent intervention so that it does not deteriorate, such intervention cannot take place outside the framework of international law, the basic principles and norms of international relations and the provisions of the United Nations Charter."
55,2000,LBR,"In my intervention last year, I renewed my Government's request for the Security Council to lift the arms embargo imposed on Liberia eight years ago in 1992."

26,1971,COG,"Today, this truth shines forth in its burning reality to teach those who have been won over by the imperialist campaign of distortion that the Chinese people, guided by its outstanding leader, Mao Tse-tung, desires only one thing: to draw closer to the other peoples of the world, to co-operate with them in all sincerity, in a completely disinterested spirit, strictly obscuring the sacred principles of equality among States, great or small, mutual respect and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other countries."
26,1971,ROU,"Romania calling for an immediate end to the war against the Viet-Namese people, as well as to the armed intervention in Cambodia and Laos."

26,1971,SGP,"These are all irresistible opportunities for successful big-Power intervention, often disguised as sympathy and aid for our respective causes."
26,1971,GTM,"In its international coexistence, as far as the sovereignty and independence of other States is concerned Guatemala has respected and complied with its commitments; and, therefore, in return we insist that the same respect be shown to our own sovereignty and we reject any intervention in our domestic affairs."

26,1971,MLT,"We visualize the Mediterranean as a zone of peace and we earnestly look forward to the day when such a prospect can become a reality, when all foreign forces alien to that sea would have been withdrawn in peace, and foreign intervention in the area would become a thing of the past."
26,1971,SYR,"The Arab people of Syria, who have fought against imperialist occupation, the crimes of colonialism and the brutality of the Nazi-type Zionist aggression in the Middle East, reaffirm their stand alongside the peoples of Africa in their destiny-deciding struggle against racial discrimination and imperialist intervention in Africa."
26,1971,PAK,"Had Indian rulers not been hostile to Pakistan, would they not find it unnatural and repugnant to try to take advantage of their neighbor's internal difficulties? Would they not scrupulously refrain from interfering in our affairs? What is happening today on the borders of my country and our neighbor India is not mere border skirmishes; it is armed intervention by one country, a Member of the United Nations, India, in the territory of another Member of the United Nations, Pakistan."
26,1971,PAK,But what are the facts? The facts about Indian intervention are patent and I have already mentioned them.
26,1971,PAK,"If the principle of non-intervention is set aside or compromised, every nation smaller or weaker than its neighbor will be open to the latter's inroads."
26,1971,DZA,It is only once the true intention of the United States to abandon any intervention in the internal affairs of South Viet-Nam is proved that the modalities for the cessation of the war can be studied.
26,1971,DZA,"Renewing in Cambodia and Laos the same tragic errors committed in Viet-Nam, the United States pursues its policy of direct intervention in the internal affairs of those countries by imposing government leaders obedient to their instructions, but deprived of any popular base."
26,1971,DZA,Their confrontation is at the level of establishing developing zones of influence for the enslavement of other peoples and often brutal intervention in their own affairs.

26,1971,PER,"We consider that any measure, pressure or sanction of such a nature would be a manifest intervention and at the same time economic aggression which would pose a threat to international peace and security."
26,1971,ITA,"That the cannons have been silent for all this time can be attributed only to the intervention of the United Nations, to the mission of Ambassador Jarring, to the advice of moderation given to the parties concerned, and to the wisdom shown by them thus far."
26,1971,ITA,"But though our Organization seems to lack the effective power and though its role with respect to problems affecting international peace and security very often exceeds its possibilities of intervention, it nevertheless still is the place where human conscience can be expressed."
26,1971,GUY,"Pledged, as we are, under the Charter to ensure ""that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest"", the pages of contemporary history continue to be filled with the record of armed conflict: of the war in IndoChina, which has now extended from VietNam into Laos and Cambodia and which will not end unless foreign intervention of ail kinds has ended and an environment secured in which incentives for reconciliation and peaceful solutions replace present incentives for obduracy and for war; of the convulsive conflicts of the Middle East, where differences over interpretation of Security Council resolutions for peace provide new bases for continuing tensions, while territory occupied by force remains a prize of war; of a miscellany of situations around the globe."
26,1971,MEX,"That is why the principles that invariably guide our foreign policy are the proscription of the use of force, the peaceful settlement of disputes, non-intervention, the juridical equality of States and the self-determination of peoples."
26,1971,HTI,"His Excellency Jean-Claude Duvalier, the youngest President in the world, declared recently: ""Out of faithfulness to the doctrine of our revolution and out of personal conviction, I believe that the principles of non-intervention on the part of one State or group of States in the internal affairs of another, and the right of peoples freely to decide their own destiny remain the basis of international law and the primary condition for harmonious relations among the various members of the international community."

26,1971,NIC,"That plurality, which we have respected, is revealing of the freedom that has been implanted in the American continent as the key to its progres"" and development, and of the observance of the principles of self- determination of peoples and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States, both of which are cornerstones of the Organization of American States."
26,1971,CUB,"The Government of the United States must be required to abide by and respect the agreements of September 1962 on Laos, to put an immediate end to the aggression and intervention against that country and, furthermore, to respect the independence, peace, neutrality and territorial integrity of Cambodia and fully, totally and unconditionally to cease its intervention in that country."
26,1971,CUB,"The peoples of Latin America remember far too well the heroic efforts of Augusto Cesar Sandino in the mountains of Nicaragua; the open intervention against Guatemala in 1954; the landing of Yankee troops in Santo Domingo in 1965; the massacres of the Panamanian people; the colonial occupation of Puerto Rico; the establishment of Fascist regimes; the slaughter of Indians, workers, peasants and students when they claimed their rights; the invasion of Cuba in 1961; and the pressures on and interference in the affairs of our peoples."
26,1971,BGR,"As long as the United States intervention goes on in south-east Asia the Viet-Namese people, enjoying the support of socialist countries, will continue to deal heavy blows to the invaders."

75,2020,CYP,"Unfortunately, despite our positive engagement and the submission of credible and realistic written proposals, the negotiations were unsuccessful due to Turkey’s inflexible stance and insistence on maintaining the anachronistic Treaty of Guarantee and the right of intervention, as well as a permanent presence of troops."
75,2020,CYP,"At the same time, I am wondering: Is it uncompromising to aspire establishing an independent and sovereign State, without any foreign guarantees, any right of intervention by a foreign country and free from the presence of occupation troops? Which other of the 193 UN member states is under Guarantees by a third country? Is it unjust to advocate establishing a normal State in which all decisions will be taken only by its citizens, free from foreign dependencies? Is it uncompromising to envision establishing a robust system of security, based on the Charter of the UN and the Treaties of the EU and the Council of Europe? Does any constitution of a Federal State provide that for every decision at a Federal Level at least one positive vote by one constituent member is required? When especially the constituent member is controlled by a third country? Distinguished Friends, I posed this argument, having in mind: a) The fact that the Turkish implanted settlers might now outnumber Turkish Cypriots, and; b) Turkey’s insistence of maintaining the Treaty of Guarantee, the right of intervention and the permanent presence of Turkish troops."

39,1984,FRA,"Then, there are places where human rights are violated by outside intervention or constraints, by the unwanted occupation of foreign troops: in Afghanistan, where armed intervention by foreign forces increases as resistance by the people increases; in the Middle East, where the Palestinian people are suffering and despair of seeing their rights recognized, of knowing at long last the homeland which will be theirs; where the State of Israel, for lack of guaranteed security—which is its inalienable right— within the borders that have been recognized by the international community, pursues a policy incompatible with the indispensable recognition of the rights  of the other peoples of the region; where Lebanon, which has already suffered so much, is unable to secure respect for the Security Council resolutions concerning the southern part of its territory and to obtain an end to all foreign presence; in southern Africa, where Council resolution 435 (1978), on Namibian independence, continues to be disregarded, even defied, while the war continues in Angola, with the presence and participation on that territory of South Africa's army; in Western Sahara, whose people have a right to self-determination; in Cambodia, that country of a great and ancient civilization, bled white by appalling genocide and now occupied by its neighbours to the east."

39,1984,BGR,"This is illustrated by the intervention in Grenada, the unremitting pressures against Cuba, the mining of ports and the conducting of subversive activities against sovereign Nicaragua, and the extension of substantial military aid to dictatorial regimes, enabling them to continue their oppressive policies and to perpetrate crimes against their own peoples."

27,1972,TCD,"Indeed, apart from observing the principles of the San Francisco Charter, my country makes it a fundamental rule of its foreign policy to foster understanding among all peoples of the world on the basis of absolute respect for human rights, equality of States and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other countries."
27,1972,TCD,"In fact, these wars are no longer the exclusive affair of the parties directly concerned and confronting each other, but derive their causes from ideological intervention and a desire for hegemony."
27,1972,HND,"Economic or political colonialism, with domination by the metropolitan country and partial or total submission on the part of the colonies, is nothing more than a manifestation of imperialism, intervention or conquest."
27,1972,SEN,"Without further delay the United Nations must echo the words of President Senghor, who stated recently: ""It is time for weapons to be silent in VietNam as well as in the Middle East so that a just and durable peace may come, based upon the self-determination of peoples, without foreign intervention."
27,1972,SOM,It is particularly noteworthy that one of these principles is the desire to avoid all foreign interference or intervention by foreign forces.
27,1972,POL,"In our opinion, conditions have now been created in Europe for the establishment of a system of commitments to safeguard the inviolability of existing frontiers and ensure respect for the territorial integrity of all States, the non-use of force and the elimination of the threat of its use in inter-State relations, while confirming the principles of the equality and sovereignty of States and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States."
27,1972,MEX,"A document of universal legal validity such as the one Mexico has suggested to the community of nations will test the readiness of the powerful countries to put into practice true international solidarity which, resting on the principles of the sovereign equality of States, non-intervention and the self-determination of peoples, and governed by binding legal rules, could become the best instrument to achieve and consolidate stable and lasting peace."
27,1972,ROU,"The Romanian Government resolutely demands that the flames of war in IndoChina be extinguished, that United States intervention against the heroic VietNamese people cease, that the bombings and other military actions stop and that United States troops be totally withdrawn, so as to enable this people, as well as the Cambodian and Laotian peoples, freely to solve their problems without any outside interference."
27,1972,TZA,An immediate end must also be put to the United States intervention in the affairs of Cambodia so that that traditionally non-aligned country can be allowed to pursue its progressive policies of peace and neutrality in complete freedom and security.
27,1972,TZA,It is the view of the Tanzanian delegation that it is now more necessary than ever before for this Organization to respond favorably to these developments by putting an end to all foreign intervention in Korea.
27,1972,MMR,"I cannot help also mentioning that elsewhere in Asia significant movements are under way to secure the recognition of and respect for the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace, and the South-East Asian region as a whole as a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality free from any form or manner of intervention by outside Powers."
27,1972,MMR,The continued rivalry and intervention of outside Powers in the States of IndoChina still threaten the peace and security of the South-East Asian region.
27,1972,MMR,"This intervention has resulted only in untold suffering, the loss of countless lives and massive material destruction."
27,1972,ALB,"True peace and security in Europe are inconceivable as long as quite near Europe in the Middle East open aggression and unprecedented imperialist intervention continue; as long as, in the south of the continent in the Mediterranean basin, aggression is increasing by dint of the presence of the aggressive fleets of the United States and the Soviet Union and their military naval bases."
27,1972,ALB,"World public opinion has severely condemned the barbarous and inhuman acts of the American army, insistently demanding that an end be put forthwith to United States armed intervention, that American soldiers immediately leave South Viet-Nam and the IndoChinese peninsula and that the VietNamese people be left free to settle its own national problems, without any foreign interference and in accordance with its own wishes."
27,1972,MRT,"Independent reunification means without any foreign intervention, but peaceful reunification also through the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in South Korea, whose presence is not likely to create a peaceful climate in which the talks now taking place between the two parties can usefully proceed."
27,1972,MRT,My delegation deeply regrets that the* General Assembly did not take the opportunity offered to it of contributing to the solution of a painful problem whose existence is due essentially to political and military intervention by the United Nations.
27,1972,COG,"The impotence of the United Nations in the face of this crime brings a bitter smile to the lips of our peoples, who have not forgotten, and can never forget, that at the time we were gaining our independence we saw the United Nations transport its troops to certain parts of Africa, not to establish the peace that was desired, but to engage in active intervention in the domestic affairs of our peoples."
27,1972,COG,"The powers of the United Nations in this Territory should be guaranteed by an international armed force which can enable the Namibian people to create, free from any foreign intervention, the conditions suitable for the exercise of its right to self-determination in unity and not in an ethnic and racial federalism which the South African racists would like to have and, as we know, they have already installed the black populations on the least desirable land."
27,1972,COG,"The People's Republic of the Congo endorses the following plan as it was enunciated by the South West Africa People's Organization: first, if on 15 September 1972 the Pretoria regime has not committed itself definitely to withdraw its administration from Namibia and has not made arrangements for that withdrawal; secondly, if South Africa does not demonstrate without ambiguity that it is prepared to recognize the right of the people of Namibia to independence as a single national entity; and thirdly, if South Africa does not commit itself clearly to recognize the political, civil, economic, social and cultural right of the Namibian people freely to determine their future without foreign intervention, then it will be useless to pursue any other form of contacts between the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the racists of Pretoria."
27,1972,BDI,"All measures or economic or political pressures from the outside, prejudicial to those rights, constitute a flagrant violation of the principles of self-determination and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States."
27,1972,NPL,We have always maintained that all the parties concerned in Indochina must find a political solution for the settlement of their problems through peaceful negotiations and that the countries of Indochina should be able to decide their ultimate destiny without any foreign intervention.
27,1972,DZA,"Can we merely speak of violence without thinking first of the situation in the IndoChinese peninsula? There, American intervention has reached unprecedented intensity and dimensions."
27,1972,DZA,"By encouraging the process which is now under way the United Nations will undoubtedly recover its prestige, tarnished during the quarter of a century during which it has served as a disguise for the intervention of the imperialist American forces and their allies."
27,1972,PER,"The Revolutionary Government of Peru considers that in the case of Viet-Nam no matter what solution may be considered to end the war, it will obviously have to be based upon the exclusion of intervention by other countries, so that the people of Viet-Nam will thus be able to exercise its right to self-determination."
27,1972,VEN,"In this connexion, in my intervention before this Assembly at the twenty-fifth session I stated that: • ""In ordinary language violence is often confused with force."
27,1972,AFG,Afghanistan has always supported a solution of the question of Viet-Nam-and of all Indochina based on the decisive role of the will of the peoples of the area themselves in determining their own destiny without any foreign intervention.
27,1972,CRI,"The political regime that would arise from the settlement could be no worse than the brutal bloodletting and destruction that the VietNamese have suffered for decades, in large measure because of foreign intervention."
27,1972,KWT,"May I express the satisfaction of the Government of Kuwait with the encouraging developments in the negotiations for the reunification of North and South Korea? Kuwait, which is opposed to the partition of any country and which steadfastly upholds the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States, sincerely hopes that the reunification of Korea will be achieved peacefully and without foreign interference and that all foreign troops will be withdrawn from Korea."
27,1972,HTI,"Almost 18 months ago President Duvalier inaugurated a new international policy based on peace and international co-operation, in respect for the principles of non-intervention, self-determination and the inalienable right of peoples freely to decide their destiny."
27,1972,RUS,The continuation and expansion of the United States intervention in Viet-Nam and other countries of Indochina provoke indignation and condemnation.
27,1972,PRT,"Everything that has been said about violence focuses attention on three themes, which are at the center of all debates and controversies: violence and its legitimate causes; the primacy of the rule of law; and the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States."
27,1972,PRT,"In an intervention of the purest medieval flavor, the representative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics spoke of terrorists who subsequently become heroes."
27,1972,PRT,But no rule has been the object of such flagrant discrimination in its application as the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States Members of the United Nations.
27,1972,PRT,The principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States is enshrined in the political Constitution of the Portuguese Republic and has guided our policies in the most diverse situations.
27,1972,PRT,"This last constitutional provision is of the utmost importance and reflects a basic idea expressed by our Prime Minister, Marcello Caetano: ""If any segregationist tendencies sKould manifest themselves locally, they will be inexorably combated by the intervention of the central Government, should this prove necessary."
27,1972,CMR,"The principles of equality among States, respect for national sovereignty and non-intervention in the affairs of other States are little respected throughout the world."
27,1972,CUB,"The Conference demanded the immediate, total and unconditional withdrawal of all North American troops, military personnel and war equipment from Viet-Nam and the cessation of intervention in that country, and called upon the North American Government to take part seriously in the Paris talks and to give a favorable response to the proposals of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet-Nam and of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam."
27,1972,CUB,"It knows perfectly well that if an end is to be put to the conflict, the United States must withdraw from Viet-Nam completely and give, up its dreams of imposing the Thieu administration, the creation of Yankee intervention, on the Viet-Namese."
27,1972,CUB,"Fraternally we greet and support the Chilean people and the Government of Popular Unity which, under the direction of President Salvador Allende, is resolutely addressing itself to the acts of intervention, pressure, intrigue, sabotage, reprisal and threats from North American imperialism, whose latest act was the arbitrary embargo on a shipment of copper decreed by a French court on the shameless insistence of the Yankee monopoly, Braden Kennecott, which itself has for years siphoned off the fruits of the sweat and sacrifice of the Chilean workers."
27,1972,IND,We have consistently held and expressed the view for a long time that force and foreign military intervention cannot bring this problem to an end.
27,1972,YMD,"Conspiracies are being organized outside our borders by imperialist and reactionary agents with the aim of intervention in our domestic affairs, thus posing a threat to the independence and the security of our people."
27,1972,YMD,"The foreign policy of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen aims at bolstering peace in the Arab world as well as in the whole world, at supporting the quest of peoples for self-determination, and at opposing any intervention in the internal affairs of States."
27,1972,YMD,For we believe that peace is unattainable until the imperialist States desist from their policies of intervention and the use of force designed to subject peoples and nations to their control and to pillage their resources.
27,1972,YMD,"Our position is in full accord with the great principles of the United Nations Charter and United Nations decisions which call for the right of all peoples to live in peace and in freedom from all forms of aggression, intervention and oppression."
27,1972,YMD,"Thus, the population of the entire area is subjected to repeated acts of aggressive intervention by imperialist forces, which are now doubling their weaponry and their military establishments and whose single aim is aggression with a view to halting the popular struggle for freedom and national independence."
27,1972,YMD,"This program calls for putting an end to United States intervention and aggression and to the Vietnamization of this war, which will meet with the same failure that has attended all other aggressive schemes as a result of the determination of the great Vietnamese people to resist aggression."
27,1972,YMD,We see how the Korean people aspire to unity and to the elimination of foreign intervention.
27,1972,YMD,"Such a state of affairs cannot continue, or we shall be contributing to the tragedy represented by the division of the Korean nation and helping to hide the crime of United States occupation and United States intervention in the internal affairs of other peoples."
27,1972,CHL,"with principles such as non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States, respect for the self-determination of peoples, human rights and peaceful coexistence, which transcend political or economic doctrines or systems."
27,1972,CHL,"We have indicated that the International Telephone and Telegraph Company (ITT), even before President Allende came to power, initiated contacts with the Government of the United States and proposed various measures for intervention in our country, including the launching literally of a plan for a campaign of economic terror."
02,1947,YUG,Such action is known the world over as “armed intervention”.
02,1947,YUG,"It is not surprising that after such intervention Greece had a regime which was on the best of terms with the United Kingdom Government, and that representatives of the latter played a direct part in the administration of the country."
02,1947,YUG,It therefore decided to resist the unbearable regime of a minority established and maintained by foreign intervention.
02,1947,YUG,"Sophoulis, who, on 26 June 1946, made the following declaration, word for word: “The intervention of the Americans in the internal affairs of our country is so considerable that we may say that Greece has surrendered a large part of her independence and has placed herself under the economic and administrative control of the United States."
02,1947,YUG,"As a result of foreign armed intervention and external economic pressure, a Member of the United Nations has lost its independence."
02,1947,YUG,Why have States which are not interfering in the internal affairs of Greece been accused of intervention for a whole year? Why has nonsense been spread — why is nonsense still being spread — such as repeals that an international brigade armed in Yugoslavia had been sent to Greece? You will recall that this particular piece of nonsense was almost immediately disproved.
02,1947,YUG,Is it really possible that those who are conducting a policy of intervention in the internal affairs of Greeks can be concealed from this Assembly by such a thin smokescreen? This problem has been on the Security Council’s agenda for nine months.
02,1947,YUG,The adoption of this proposal would have given his country a free hand for future intervention in Greek internal affairs.
02,1947,YUG,"This attempt can only be attributed to a hope of achieving what could not be achieved in the Council; namely, to obtain from us, here and now, a free hand, for the continuation of American intervention in Greece, or even for eventual armed intervention."
02,1947,DOM,"That being so, intervention by the United Nations in this affair is fully justified by the necessity of clarifying the position and lending Greece such assistance as circumstances may require for the purpose of freeing it from those foreign elements which are trying to create a state of anarchy there in violation of the respect due to the sovereignty of nations."
02,1947,SLV,"This is a most emphatic acceptance of the principle of non-intervention which was first recognized by twenty-one American Republics in the Convention on the Rights and Duties of the States, signed at Montevideo in December 1933."
02,1947,SLV,At San Francisco the delegations of the same American Republics were intent upon retaining the same principle in our Charter; it is obvious to me that my delegation — and I assume that this is true of all other delegations — would not have signed the Charter unless its text contained a most praise recognition of the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States.
02,1947,SLV,"I express the hope, therefore, that whatever mistakes we may have made in the past, the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States will henceforth be respected by our international Organization and that no undue interference in the internal affairs of any sovereign nation may ever be consummated."
02,1947,COL,"While we are reconsidering our structure, it is timely to note that the prestige of the United Nations has been steadfastly deciding because leading European and American States have bypassed the Organization or disregarded the recommendations of its principal organs whenever their intervention has threatened to interfere with or prejudice their national policies or wishes."
02,1947,UKR,"There is not the slightest doubt that the support given by the United States of America to the Kuomintang in its civil war against the democratic forces of China is in blatant contradiction to the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of another country, which, as we all know, is at the very root of the United Nations Charter."
02,1947,UKR,"Equally incompatible with the basic principles of the Charter is the open intervention in the domestic affairs of Greece conducted by the United Kingdom, which maintains a part of its armed forces on Greek territory in order to support and maintain the anti-popular, monarchist and fascist regime which has brought Greece to a state of permanent civil war and which threatens to develop into a war against the peace-loving Balkan States."
02,1947,UKR,"This aimed intervention by the United Kingdom has upset the peace and tranquillity of Greece after its liberation from the German aggresors, and has led to civil war, the outcome of which is the political bankruptcy of the monarchist and fascist regime and the collapse of British policy."
02,1947,UKR,"This collapse is not accidental; for those who imagined they could suppress the Greek people with the aid of foreign intervention overlooked the fact that nations, even the smallest of them, are not the same after a war as when they entered it, and that it is now impossible to govern peoples by terror since terror merely evokes still greater popular resistance, drawing into the struggle people who were previously nonpolitical and passive."
02,1947,UKR,"With the same aims in view, this question has been submitted in its “Tsaldaris” version to the General Assembly, with whose authority it is hoped to cloak a new intervention in Greece."
02,1947,UKR,"The real essence of the Greek question lies in this intervention, which is designed to duplicate or replace the intervention of Great Britain."
02,1947,UKR,"What would you have said, gentlemen, if your country, which suffered fewer casualties than Greece in the war against fascist Aggression, had to accept intervention by foreign troops? Why cap this be done to Greece? Why is the Greek people refused the right which the Yalta Conference gave all the liberated peoples of Europe “to destroy the last vestiges of nazism and fascism and to create democratic institutions of their own choice”? On what grounds are the Greek people being deprived of the-right to solve their internal conflicts by themselves and to be the masters in their own country? What right had Great Britain to dictate to the Greek people the dates of the parliamentary elections, to fix the date of the plebiscite, and to form  — as it is forming even now, with the co-operation of the United States Government — Greek governments acceptable to itself? What right had Great Britain to form the Tsaldaris Government, of which one may say that its longevity depends on how long it takes to conclude the discussion of the Greek question? It is the prerogative of the sovereign Greek people to make decisions on such matters."
02,1947,UKR,"The representative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in the Security Council would not have done his duty to the sixteen Republics comprising the Soviet Union, nor his duty to the United Nations, if he had voted for the proposal to set up a High Commissioner or a permanent Commission, for such a proposal is a preliminary step towards a new intervention in Greece and is designed to extend the intervention in Greece's internal affairs to other Balkan countries also."
02,1947,EGY,It is due to outsiders who have not yet ceased to regard our part of the world as a free field for adventure and intervention.
02,1947,BLR,"Hitler’s army and Mussolini’s troops, taking advantage of the policy of “non-intervention”, forcibly set up a fascist regime under Franco."
54,1999,CUB,"What would we have left to defend ourselves in the future if we poor countries were no longer able to rely on such principles as respect for sovereignty and self- determination, the sovereign equality of all States and non- interference in the internal affairs of other nations? How could we call on the international community to protest a threat against one of our countries if those principles, which are today systematically and flagrantly violated, were to be struck from the Charter of the United Nations? In a unipolar world, attempts to impose notions such as the limitation of sovereignty, and humanitarian intervention, do not advance international security: they pose a threat to the countries of the Third World, which have neither powerful armies nor nuclear weapons."
54,1999,MDG,"Nevertheless, in our view these actions should be in keeping with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, such as respect for the sovereignty of States, respect for territorial integrity and non-intervention in internal affairs."
54,1999,PAK,"Ten years after the foreign intervention ended, almost 3 million Afghan refugees are still in Pakistan and Iran."
54,1999,HND,"Both the intervention of the Security Council in the Kosovo conflict just recently and the organization of an international peacekeeping force for East Timor illustrate the efficacy of this system, which makes all of us brethren, neighbours, friends and partners."
54,1999,ARE,"This must be based on the principles of good neighbourliness, confidence-building measures, peaceful coexistence, non- intervention in the internal affairs of countries, mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, renunciation of the threat or use of force and the settlement of existing disputes through dialogue and peaceful means."
54,1999,AFG,"” 10   In fact, it is the intervention of Pakistan in Afghanistan, its support for the Taliban and its attempts to justify the Taliban’s defiance of the aspirations of the international community, including reprehensible attempts at Taliban recognition, which has eroded Pakistan’s reputation, causing its political isolation throughout the world."
54,1999,AFG,"However, despite Talibanism and Pakistan’s massive military intervention in Afghanistan — both of which represent obvious breaches of the United Nations Charter, international law and international humanitarian law — we are delighted to note that the United Nations, following years of skepticism or illusory thinking, appears, perhaps for the first time and only since the open escalation of foreign military involvement in Afghanistan, to have developed an in-depth perception of the longstanding bitter reality of the Pakistani role, its intervention, and the Taliban agenda in Afghanistan."
54,1999,AFG,"The United Nations is also expected to use its good offices to convince the Pakistani leadership, including its military intelligence wing, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), to steer its policy away from intervention in Afghanistan and towards non-intervention, so that we can move from a Pakistani-dictated position of subordination to a mutually dictated position of cooperation."
54,1999,IRQ,"The most dangerous phenomenon witnessed during the present decade, which in the course of this session has become an endeavour orchestrated by a group of Western States, is the advocacy of so-called humanitarian intervention."
54,1999,IRQ,"These principles cannot provide a protective shield for grave violations of human rights or for intervention, sometimes with the use of force, in order to protect those rights."
54,1999,IRQ,"Regardless of what the Charter provides in terms of rights, duties and procedures, we are convinced that the doctrine of presumed humanitarian intervention represents a dangerous destructive tool that affects the gains that have accrued through joint efforts in favour of the general international interest, as evidenced by the records of this Organization."
54,1999,BHS,"At the same time, they remind us that the greatest care must be taken in making exceptions to the general principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States."
54,1999,AND,Peacekeeping must be conducted using more powerful and better organized mechanisms of intervention that allow for rapid action and guarantee the effective conversion of words into deeds.
54,1999,AND,Support for the system depends on the United Nations having a real capacity for intervention so that peacekeeping is more effective.
54,1999,NLD,I know that many interventions share a common element — they compare the notion of sovereignty to that of human rights and territorial integrity to humanitarian intervention.
54,1999,UZB,"With the help of international organizations, the opinion that the Aral Sea crisis can be resolved only through humanitarian intervention has gradually taken root in the perception of the international community."
54,1999,RUS,It is from this very perspective that we assess such doctrines as that of humanitarian intervention.
54,1999,GRC,"Can human suffering be subordinated to sovereignty? Can we afford to be inconsistent in the application of military intervention? Is it right to impose trade sanctions on Governments that violate international rules, at the expense of their innocent populations? We seek to globalize values."
54,1999,GRC,The tragic events in Kosovo will be remembered for acts of brutal ethnic cleansing and a military intervention that ensued without the authorization of the Security Council.
54,1999,JAM,"In accordance with the principles of national sovereignty, he will need the cooperation and support of Member States in his efforts for the maintenance of peace, as delicate problems can arise in relation to any process of diplomatic intervention with respect to the role to be undertaken by the United Nations and appropriate regional organizations."
54,1999,JAM,"During the past year, events in the Balkans have raised profound questions about the principle of intervention, the use of force, the scale of military enforcement and the role of the Security Council."
54,1999,THA,"Rather than State rights, State interests, State sovereignty, we now have to grapple with the defence of the common good, the protection of rights beyond borders and intervention to promote and safeguard humanitarian ideals and objectives."
54,1999,THA,"But let us not forget that before we can protect and promote those common interests, save rights beyond borders and think about intervention on the ground of humanitarian concerns, we have to make sure that we are in agreement about what it is that we must, that we want to, protect and promote."
54,1999,LIE,"How can we reconcile the role given to the Security Council under the Charter of the United Nations with a “humanitarian intervention” not mandated by the Council? What does this mean for the future of the Security Council and of the Organization as a whole? Are regional organizations to assume a leading role that goes beyond what is contained in Chapter VIII of the Charter? It will be important to discuss these 33   questions, though finding satisfactory answers is certainly difficult."
54,1999,CAN,"In the field of conflict, the United Nations is now attempting to rebuild the broken fields of Kosovo after an unprecedented intervention for humanitarian reasons."
54,1999,CAN,Clear and consistent criteria are needed against which the necessity or otherwise of humanitarian intervention — including enforcement — can be judged and applied.
54,1999,CHL,We are pleased that the Republic of Indonesia has requested the intervention of the United Nations to put an end to violence on the island.
54,1999,PRY,"Paraguay is convinced that maintaining international peace and security must continue to be one of the priorities of the United Nations, in particular in those areas of conflict where its intervention can contribute decisively to stabilizing the situation on the ground and achieving peace."
54,1999,LBY,"The slogan that is now much in vogue, “humanitarian intervention”, will help erode the little that remains of State sovereignty."
54,1999,LBY,We declare our absolute rejection of intervention under any slogan.
54,1999,LBY,"We demand the immediate lifting of sanctions imposed on Iraq, and we emphasize the importance of preserving its unity and territorial integrity, respect for its sovereignty, non-intervention in its internal affairs and ending the ongoing military aggression against it."
54,1999,EGY,"Also included is the call for humanitarian intervention and its scope, a suggested role for transnational corporations and the concept of the assessment of the security impact of development policies, which could open the door for new conditionalities if these ideas are not developed democratically, objectively and non-selectively."
54,1999,ATG,"As one who represents his country on the Committee of 24, the so-called Decolonization Committee, I was somewhat taken aback to hear the Foreign Minister of a country that had previously supported non-intervention state that the United Nations has failed to address well- known conflicts of catastrophic proportions in a timely manner."
54,1999,ATG,"Like other countries, my country believes that intervention in affairs within another State should be the last resort."
54,1999,ATG,"I have long marvelled at the prophetic brilliance of the former Foreign Minister of Uruguay, Eduardo Rodr'guez Larreta, who in 1946 argued that non-intervention could not be converted into a right to convoke one principle in order to violate all other principles with impunity."
54,1999,DEU,"The intervention in Kosovo, which took place in a situation where the Security Council had tied its own hands after all efforts to find a peaceful solution had failed, was intended to provide emergency assistance and, ultimately, to protect the displaced Kosovo Albanians."
54,1999,SGP,"The doctrine of humanitarian intervention dates from the nineteenth century, when the powerful claimed the right to intervene in the affairs of the weak."
54,1999,SGP,"The Secretary-General then asked, what is the common interest? Who shall define it? Who will defend it? Under whose authority? With what means of intervention? I agree with the Secretary-General that these questions will need to be answered and criteria established."
54,1999,SGP,This is because we can expect to face many more situations which will pose the dilemma of reconciling State sovereignty with international intervention to redress violations of human rights.
54,1999,MLT,"Kofi Annan, for his incessant diplomatic intervention to help resolve conflicts in various parts of the globe."
54,1999,KEN,"In accordance with the United Nations Charter, the Security Council has the primary responsibility to determine the existence of any threat to international peace and security and to recommend appropriate intervention measures."
54,1999,KEN,We have serious reservations on the evolving view that even the United Nations Charter provides leeway for non-United Nations intervention.
54,1999,KEN,"Whatever we may say on intervention, the sovereignty of States remains at the core of diplomatic discourse."
54,1999,ROU,"This way of thinking has lately brought up the issue of humanitarian intervention, human rights and reform of the system of international law."
54,1999,ROU,There are those who say that we should not tolerate legal injustice under the pretext of 39   humanitarian intervention.
54,1999,UGA,The principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States has been so fundamentally eroded that the international community should now openly adopt a definitive convention which will permit instant intervention in cases of massive threats to the right to life.
54,1999,AUS,The first is perhaps the most fundamental task before this Organization: the maintenance of global peace and security through humanitarian intervention.
54,1999,ISL,"In this regard, I would like to endorse the position put forward on humanitarian intervention by the Secretary- General."
54,1999,TUN,I should like in this regard to address the question of so-called “humanitarian intervention”.
54,1999,SYR,"Clearly, many are dissatisfied with the use of humanitarian pretexts to launch military intervention outside the framework of the Security Council."
54,1999,SYR,"It began with the intervention in Somalia in 1992, whose repercussions included the collapse of all State institutions and the carving up of the capital, Mogadishu, among fighting warlords."
54,1999,SYR,"This trend continued with the intervention in Kosovo, where the fate of the people remains in the balance, although the intervention succeeded in supplying the people with medicine and food."
54,1999,SYR,"But here it must be said that illegitimate intervention outside the framework of the Security Council is not as bad as completely ignoring dangerous and bloody crises such as those beyond what might be called the line of death and hunger: a line stretching from the Horn of Africa, in the east, to Angola, in the west, and then to Rwanda, Burundi and the Congo."
54,1999,SYR,It expresses its support also for the aspirations of the Korean people for national unity achieved by peaceful means and free of foreign intervention.
54,1999,PLW,"Palau also expresses its appreciation and support for the efforts of the Security Council in promoting peace, security and the protection of human rights and democracy throughout the world, and especially in troubled areas in need of United Nations intervention."
54,1999,BGR,"For example, the world Organization is in serious need of a mechanism for compensating neighbouring States for damage caused by international intervention or sanctions."
54,1999,SAU,This situation was reversed only by the intervention of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces after Serbia refused to accept the provisions of the Rambouillet agreement.
54,1999,POL,"This is not an easy task, first, because there are still too many cases where behind hypocritical lip-service to human rights there exist practices of curbing and limiting those rights for the sake of preserving political power; secondly, because the legal framework of intervention, which should ensure the possibility of quick and effective action, is too often distorted by selective and subjective interpretations."
54,1999,POL,"On the one hand, the banner of humanitarian intervention should not be used as a pretext for imposing political control and domination from the outside."
54,1999,POL,"On the other hand, the principle of humanitarian intervention has to be fairly and consistently applied to avoid double standards."
54,1999,POL,Acting for universal observance of human rights while preserving the necessary content of the notion of sovereignty raises the question of the best strategies for humanitarian intervention.
54,1999,POL,We have but to agree that intervention by force is an instrument of last resort.
54,1999,POL,There is no doubt that armed intervention is a sign of the failure of cooperative methods.
54,1999,DNK,"The Secretary-General has said, “any armed intervention is itself a result of the failure of prevention”."
54,1999,FRA,"Consequently, we must uphold the principle of international intervention, under United Nations auspices, to assist the victims."
54,1999,GTM,We believe that United Nations involvement in such situations confirms its functions as the sole organ competent to decide on the action to be taken in cases where the principle of non-intervention needs to be interpreted with due regard to the existence of violations of international humanitarian law.
54,1999,CPV,"In Angola, unfortunately, hostilities have resumed and the prospects for the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol have vanished, despite United Nations intervention, which, it must be acknowledged, has not been successful."
54,1999,MDA,The Secretary-General is absolutely right when he stresses that a tragic irony of many of the crises that continue to go unnoticed and unchallenged today is that they could be dealt with by far less perilous acts of intervention than the one we witnessed recently in Yugoslavia.
54,1999,COL,"I would like from this rostrum solemnly to state that Colombia, true to the principles that govern our Republic, rejects any foreign interference or intervention in its internal affairs."
54,1999,COL,"These are times of cooperation, not intervention."
54,1999,RWA,"There is no need for me to revisit those outrageous accusations, because our representative has had the occasion to explain our intervention in the crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo."
54,1999,SLV,Let me acknowledge United Nations assistance and intervention in my country.
54,1999,GAB,"On that occasion, President Bongo proposed the creation of an African agency for emergency humanitarian intervention."
54,1999,BFA,"I cannot fail to mention the military intervention of the NATO countries in Yugoslavia and more specifically in Kosovo, an operation whose legitimacy was supposedly based on the right of humanitarian intervention."
54,1999,BFA,"But my country, Burkina Faso, is among those that believe that such an intervention should take place only on the basis of a clear and precise mandate and under the supervision of the United Nations."
54,1999,BFA,"Though the objective of this type of intervention — protecting a victimized minority — may seem defensible, the manner in which it was carried out is a cause for concern because it represents a challenge to the United Nations and to the basic norms of international law."
54,1999,BEL,The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) intervention has appreciably reinforced the idea that moral and ethical considerations are in the process of overshadowing the traditional concept of national sovereignty in international relations.
54,1999,BEL,"Article 42 of the United Nations Charter allows the Council to qualify such violations as a threat to international peace and security and to authorize armed intervention, as it has on several occasions — for example, in Iraqi Kurdistan in 1991; in Somalia in 1992; in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1994; and in Liberia and Sierra Leone in 1997."
54,1999,BEL,"If the Security Council could not fully play its role at the beginning of the Kosovo crisis, this was due less to a divergence of views between States over the essence of the problem than because there was a rift between the advocates of the right of humanitarian intervention and the defenders of the traditional legal system, which regards national sovereignty as the absolute foundation of international relations."
54,1999,BEL,"From economic and social development to disarmament or humanitarian intervention, there is a central theme that underlies all our actions: human rights."
54,1999,DZA,"But it also revealed how insubstantial North-South cooperation is, showing that it is often limited by policies based on vested interests or selective intervention."
54,1999,OMN,"We are thankful for the timely intervention by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Kosovo, especially after the failure to carry out the Rambouillet Agreement, to put an end to the pain and suffering of the provinces' inhabitants."
54,1999,MCO,"The armed intervention and the decisive role played by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia at The Hague, brought to bear in defence of the principles of humanity and human rights, seem to foreshadow a strengthened determination on the part of the international community to enforce respect for the fundamental values of justice and human dignity that inspired the San Francisco Charter."
54,1999,BRB,"27   We wish to reiterate, together with the members of the Caribbean Community, that military intervention should be authorized by the United Nations Security Council."
54,1999,BRB,"As a small, defenceless State, we are uncomfortable with the notion that intervention can take place without the prior authorization of the United Nations Security Council."
54,1999,MOZ,It is our earnest hope that the United Nations intervention in Kosovo will bring lasting peace and stability to that territory and the region.
54,1999,CHN,"Military blocs are being expanded and reinforced, and there is an increasing tendency towards military intervention."
54,1999,CHN,Such arguments as human rights taking precedence over sovereignty and humanitarian intervention seem to be in vogue these days.
54,1999,CHN,The Kosovo crisis has proved that to engage in so- called humanitarian intervention in a sovereign State with neither a mandate from the Security Council nor the prior consent of the country concerned will cause a greater humanitarian catastrophe instead of resolving the problem.
54,1999,GMB,The Security Council must therefore be evenhanded and establish principled criteria for humanitarian intervention.
54,1999,WSM,I would agree with the Secretary-General that it is critical to set clear criteria for international action and intervention.
54,1999,SWE,"I would like to highlight four key areas that we, the United Nations and its Member States, need to address to make the United Nations truly relevant: the questions of intervention; early action and prevention; nuclear disarmament; and human rights."
54,1999,SWE,"When it comes to intervention to secure peace, regional organizations and arrangements, as well as so- called coalitions of the willing, can have important roles, together with the United Nations, as we have just seen in East Timor."
54,1999,SWE,"Humanitarian intervention has to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, in view of the values at stake and whether all other means have been exhausted."
54,1999,CIV,The Kosovo crisis and military intervention under the auspices of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have only increased our doubts and questions in this connection.
54,1999,HRV,"The military intervention of the international community, supported by all the countries of the region, including Croatia, must now be followed up with an appropriate political response."
11,1956,EGY,"Yet what have they done? Have they, by their aggression, maintained freedom of navigation in the Canal — that freedom over which they were feigning to shed so many tears? Or is not the Canal completely discounted for a long time, thanks to their intervention? Have they shown respect for the Charter of the United Nations, or is the Charter groaning in anguish because of their actions? Has Israel maintained the Armistice Agreement with Egypt, or shall we believe Mr."
11,1956,ECU,The conflict in the Middle East and the cruel armed intervention of which Hungary has been the victim both spring from the same cause: the violation of law by the use of force.
11,1956,RUS,They needed a pretext to divert the attention of the public from the armed intervention of the colonialists in Egypt and the preparations for aggression against the Governments of the Arab East.
11,1956,BOL,The world yearns for the day when people will be able to live free from the fear of war and aggression and from any threat of foreign intervention in their domestic affairs.
11,1956,BOL,"Unfortunately, our concern is today rendered more acute by the position taken by those who invaded Egyptian territory, and those who violated the fundamental principle of non-intervention by interfering in the internal affairs of the people of Hungary."
11,1956,BOL,The great Powers are capable of defending themselves and it is only the small nations that run the risk of aggression or illegal intervention.
11,1956,BOL,"If the question of nationalization of the Universal Suez Canal Company were dealt with in that manner, the only problem would be the amount of money the Egyptian Government owed the Company; that matter could be settled with proper respect to the sovereignty of Egypt and it is no justification for a military offensive which has all the characteristics of colonialist intervention."
11,1956,BOL,"Not only is non-intervention in the affairs of other States an obligation, but it must be respected as an indispensable principle that enables peoples to live together."
11,1956,BOL,"We fully realize, however, that the nature of the problem is such that the General Assembly must be very careful not to give the impression that in defending the principle of non-intervention it is advocating interference in the domestic affairs of a sovereign Member State, 125."
11,1956,BOL,"At the same time, the presence of Soviet armed forces inside Hungary makes this a clear case of intervention by a foreign Power in the domestic life of that State."
11,1956,BOL,The United Nations must therefore do everything in its power to bring this intervention to an end.
11,1956,HTI,"The armed intervention of Israel, France and the United Kingdom in Egyptian territory, and the decisions which the General Assembly found it necessary to take at its emergency special session, confirm an absolute principle of contemporary law, namely, that in international relations, preventive war, such as Israel claims to have launched, and punitive war, such as that undertaken by France and the United Kingdom, are illegal, however important the national interests invoked to justify them."
11,1956,VEN,"Venezuela, in the person of its Liberator, contributed to the independence of other countries, so that by history and tradition it is opposed to any form of intervention, from whatever source, and to any act against the political independence and territorial integrity of a State."
11,1956,VEN,"The unjustifiable intervention to which that country, with its noble cultural traditions, has been subjected has shaken the civilized world, which in one way or another has shown its sympathy for Hungary’s aspirations towards independence."
11,1956,IRQ,"Thus, one should not minimize the seriousness and gravity of local wars or so-called “incidents” or “police measures” or “armed conflicts” initiated by the intervention and attack of great Powers against smaller ones, nor should we minimize the danger of war developing between smaller States which identify their interests with one great Power or another."
11,1956,IRQ,"This is a time when the world has been deeply shaken by Israel aggression, by the French and British attack on Egypt, and by Soviet intervention to subjugate the people of Hungary — events that brought us to the brink of a third world war."
11,1956,IRQ,"Once these legitimate rights and aspirations of the Arabs are realized and the Arab world is freed from foreign pressure and intervention, the Arabs will move much quicker along the path of national unity, democracy and social progress."
11,1956,IRQ,We also know that by the same method of Soviet intervention the communization of the mainland of China was brought about.
11,1956,IRQ,"This, in turn, has led to a race in armaments on a scale hitherto unknown in human history, Soviet intervention in Hungary demonstrates a source of danger of great magnitude to world peace."
11,1956,NZL,New Zealand’s attitude towards Anglo-French intervention in the recent fighting between Egypt and Israel has already been made clear.
11,1956,NZL,Certainly in the past fortnight there has been no disinclination on the part of the majority in the Security Council or the General Assembly to deal with the situation created by the Israel attack on Egypt and the Anglo-French intervention.
11,1956,YUG,"It has already been recognized in this connexion that, apart from the fate of the military action, the intervention was, politically, a complete failure."
11,1956,PAN,The United Nations could not remain indifferent to the tragedy now being enacted in Hungary as a result of Soviet intervention.
11,1956,PAN,"On this question of foreign intervention, I should stress that the Latin American peoples have always been extremely jealous of their sovereignty and territorial integrity."
11,1956,PAN,"Throughout their history, they have opposed any attempt at any kind of intervention, however ostensibly well-intentioned; for the results are always disastrous for the State concerned."
11,1956,CUB,"The intervention of Soviet troops — as a result of which 65,000 Hungarian citizens have been killed, twice that number, including women and children, seriously wounded, and those taken prisoner deported to Siberia — is a serious violation of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the principle of self-determination and non-intervention, which constitute the very corner-stone of our international Organization."
11,1956,CUB,"The Cuban Government again protests most vehemently against those excesses of the Soviet troops, and publicly states that it will continue to insist that the right of the unhappy people of Hungary to live in peace without the illegal intervention of foreign troops should be recognized."
11,1956,CHL,The Assembly has reaffirmed its resolutions concerning this acute problem and has thereby demonstrated the almost unanimous conviction of the free nations that Hungary has been the victim of outside intervention and of acts of repression which constitute violation of the principles which each Member of the United Nations has pledged itself to observe and respect.
11,1956,CHL,"My country is among those which are eager, to give the victims of ruthless foreign intervention in Hungary homes and security, and it has already begun to issue the necessary authorizations for the entry of up to 1,000 Hungarian refugees."
11,1956,IRN,"What were the motives for this military intervention at a time when we seemed to be making progress toward a peaceful solution? We are right to ask this question, for at the very moment when this military intervention was taking place the Secretary-General was still offering his good offices for the purpose of exploring and defining the existing possibilities for solving the Suez problem in accordance with the requirements laid down by the Security Council."
11,1956,IRN,"We have reviewed the main points of this declaration in order to show that these four Powers, which are co-signatories of the Baghdad Pact and at the same time loyal to the principles of the United Nations Charter, did not hesitate to condemn Israel’s acts of aggression as well as the military intervention of the United Kingdom, once they had decided that the latter had acted in violation of the Charter."
11,1956,IRN,We condemn aggression and intervention against the freedom of a people from whatever quarter.
11,1956,CHN,The armed intervention of the Soviet Union in Hungary and the brutal manner in which the armed forces of the Soviet Union have acted reveal to the whole world the real nature of contemporary Soviet imperialism.
11,1956,SYR,"As a result of their action in the Middle East, they may bring intervention and activate tensions between the two major world Powers, the United States and the Soviet Union."
11,1956,SYR,"They know better than anybody that small wars in the Middle East have consistently called for determined intervention, and that small wars, in that central area, can only lead to big wars."
11,1956,PRT,As regards the problem of Hungary — that heart-breaking affair which has shaken and still shakes the conscience of the world — it is my earnest hope that the United Nations will find feasible means of remedying the immense evil that has been done and re-establishing as a living reality the essential principle of non-intervention by other States in the internal affairs of any nation.
11,1956,PRT,The situation is still worse when intervention is coupled with violence — and violence of so terrible a kind.
11,1956,ISR,The campaign of terror unleashed against Israel was not stopped by the intervention of the United Nations.
11,1956,URY,"As State intervention for purposes of public interest extends, so the reaffirmation of respect for the classic individual rights and the economic and social rights which allow all human beings to live in dignity becomes more necessary."
11,1956,ETH,"Here again, the sad experiences of most members of the African-Asian group unite them solidly in resolute opposition to all forms of attack against, or interference with, their political independence and all violations of the principle of non-intervention."
11,1956,ETH,"At this stage, I would draw the attention of the Assembly merely to the fact that it would be failing in its duty were it to ignore the disturbing fact that the same problem now exists also in Africa, and that the United Nations cannot hope to maintain respect for the principles of non-intervention and of political as well as territorial integrity and independence in one part of the world, if it should allow them to be threatened or ignored, as they are, in another."
11,1956,NOR,"The outbreak of hostilities through the invasion of Egypt by Israel forces, followed by the intervention of British and French forces in the Suez Canal area, came as a shock to us and, I am sure, to many other friends of these three countries."
11,1956,ESP,"The obligations imposed on Egypt by the Convention of 1888 would not, in our view, justify the intervention of an international body which would relieve Egypt of responsibility for directly complying with those obligations."
11,1956,ESP,"This they did regardless of the fact that the nations participating in the London Conferences, and the United Nations Security Council itself, had repeatedly expressed hopes for a peaceful settlement even though the renewed hostilities between Israel and Egypt provided a pretext for military intervention."
11,1956,GTM,"In Hungary, in the absence of such acquiescence, it would have taken a large army to carry out police duties, and its intervention would almost inevitably have led to the third world War which we in the United Nations are striving to avoid."
11,1956,GTM,"Until a short time ago, there were four immediate problems to be settled in the Middle East: the cease-fire, the withdrawal of troops, the clearing of the Canal and a fourth problem which, in spite of its negative character, is of fundamental importance for solving the other problems of the Middle East, namely, that of the absolute need for all Member States to refrain from any direct or indirect intervention in that area, such action being in contravention of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly during its first emergency special session and during the present session."
11,1956,ITA,"There may be some to whose interest it is to focus attention on the intervention of the United Kingdom, France and Israel, for the sole purpose of diverting attention from the situation that existed before."
11,1956,ITA,"Whatever our opinions may be on the military intervention in Egypt, we should realize that it is not enough to have ended hostilities; steps must be taken to change the status quo ante by means of a settlement likely to restore confidence and security in an area where the situation has been deteriorating during the past few sterile and troubled years."
11,1956,ITA,"One such crack is provided by military intervention in another country, with the claim that it is not aggression because the authorities of the country which is the victim of the intervention have requested it."
11,1956,ITA,"I venture to point out that when Nazi troops invaded Czechoslovakia in March 1939 the Hitler Government justified its intervention by stating that President Hacha, who then represented the highest authority in Czechoslovakia, had requested it."
11,1956,ITA,"Any military intervention whatsoever by one country in another country, whatever the causes, must be considered an act of aggression if international law is to have universal application, just as criminal law has universal application within each State."
11,1956,DOM,"We submit that it would be intolerable if communism, by direct intervention with forces of the Soviet Union, were to impose on the Hungarians a Government which they do not want, particularly after they had indicated their intention of shaping the policy of their country along lines more in keeping with universal democracy."
11,1956,TUN,"But it is the survival of colonialism to which I have just referred that may bring about the destruction of mankind, for, because it permits, encourages or causes aggression against weak or defenceless peoples, it may as a result of intervention that is virtually inevitable, at any moment provoke the general conflagration we all dread."
11,1956,TUN,"As we see it, such intervention by the United Nations would be friendly and constructive."
11,1956,SLV,"Gustavo Guerrero, my eminent compatriot, vigorously supported the proclamation in this hemisphere, as part of American international law, of the principle of non-intervention by any State in the affairs of another, a principle which has been enshrined since 1933 in various important inter-American documents, including the Charter of the Organization of American States, or the Bogota Charter, one which no serious statesman or jurist worthy of the name would venture to question."
11,1956,CRI,"Although our intervention has not yet been sufficient to restore the freedom and rights of the people of Hungary, we can at least say that our action successfully localized the conflict that broke out in the Near East, and that at one point seemed close to involving us in a war of incalculable and suicidal proportions."
11,1956,MMR,"We cannot, therefore, see any justification for any intervention, armed or otherwise, by any Power, in order to ensure its interests in the Canal."
11,1956,MMR,"Nothing has been gained, in fact, much has been lost — lives, property, friendly relations, encouragement of unprincipled intervention into the affairs of small Powers by big Powers — since the United Kingdom and France militarily intervened in Egypt."
11,1956,MMR,The armed intervention of the Soviet Union B in the internal affairs of Hungary cannot be condoned and must be condemned.
11,1956,IRL,"But we have a historical background which may, perhaps, qualify us to make a relevant intervention in this matter."
11,1956,IRL,It would not be blocked now had it not been for the rash intervention of England and France.
11,1956,IRL,"In that way, they can best reassure their friends and disarm their enemies; in that way, they can best avert the danger of further intervention in their affairs, from the East as well as from the West; in that way, they can best ensure that the eventual settlement of the status of the Canal will be one that absolutely respects Egyptian sovereignty."
11,1956,IRL,It also furnishes a standing stock of pretexts for such intervention.
11,1956,HUN,"Although this act by Egypt in no way contravened international law, the United Kingdom and France decided on armed intervention."
11,1956,FRA,The main causes of these failures are undoubtedly the abuse of the right of veto by the Soviet Union; the General Assembly’s inability to make a sufficiently objective study of the problems and compel respect for its recommendations; the fact that the effects and not the causes of the political crises which come before us for discussion are considered and the difficulties — and I shall revert to this point in a few moments — of choosing between conciliation and intervention in disputes in progress.
11,1956,FRA,"To return to recent events, the question facing France and the United Kingdom was this: what could and should our two countries do in face of a conflict that had become sooner or later inevitable? Our Governments were guided by the following considerations: the need to take account of the facts of the situation and the impotence of the United Nations in the Middle East; the avoidance of any discrimination in principle between the Arab countries and Israel but without forgetting Colonel Nasser’s persistent threats; the desire to try to protect the Canal zone (because of circumstances we were unable to prevent Egypt from blocking the Canal without any military justification and breach of the 1888 Constantinople Convention) ; the desire to avert Soviet intervention, which for several months had taken the form of large-scale shipments of arms of all kinds and which might ultimately have resulted in the outbreak of a world war."
11,1956,FRA,"We also noted the great wisdom of the Arab countries which gave Egypt moral support, as was natural, but refrained from direct intervention in the conflict."
11,1956,AUS,"As has been pointed out from the start, the Anglo-French intervention had limited aims."
11,1956,MAR,We associate ourselves with the unanimous condemnation of this action and we express the hope that energetic intervention by the United Nations in order to save the peace of the world will ensure the withdrawal of the foreign troops from the invaded territory of a country which is a Member of the United Nations.
11,1956,IDN,"The two emergency special sessions of the General Assembly, called in order to deal with the aggression against Egypt and the intervention in Hungary, have cast an ominous shadow over the start of this session."
11,1956,IDN,Yet these two events — the aggression against Egypt and the intervention in Hungary — should be seen as parts or aspects of a much wider problem.
11,1956,NPL,"We deplore the invasion of Egypt by Israel, the United Kingdom and France in the same terms in which we deplore the Soviet armed intervention in Hungary."
18,1963,NGA,"But due to the skillful intervention of the Secretary-General and of Members of this great Organization, and thanks to the good-will and sanity that prevailed and to the fact that the two most powerful nations in the Organization rose to the occasion and showed a great sense of leadership and appreciation of the yearning of all men and women of this globe, disaster was averted."
18,1963,JOR,Direct intervention across the Congolese borders can no longer be claimed.
18,1963,CHL,"We have always been in favour of the self-determination of peoples, and we have with deep conviction defended also the principle of non-intervention."
18,1963,SWE,"Gromyko, in his intervention on 19 September 1963 [1208th meeting] that a conference of the States Members of the Eighteen-Nation Committee on Disarmament, with participation of leading statesman at the highest level, should be convened."
18,1963,SLV,"In its foreign policy, El Salvador has always sincerely shown and will continue to show the fullest respect for the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other countries, a principle which it would like to see respected in every case by all other nations, for, like the Illustrious Mexican statesman Benito Juárez, we believe that respect for the rights of others equals peace."
18,1963,EGY,"It has also expressed its desire to the Government of the United Arab Republic that the latter extend its co-operation in the economic development of Yemen, and in safeguarding it against hostile foreign intervention."
18,1963,EGY,"It remains for me therefore to say how ardently the Government of the United Arab Republic, together with many others, desires to see an end to all outside hostile intervention in the internal affairs of Yemen, and a full measure of peace around that noble and ancient country which is doing its best to step into modernity and to be able, as it is willing, to make increasingly an abundant contribution to sound international life and the prosperity of the world."
18,1963,ISR,"We are firm believers in the value of such fruitful and friendly co-operation, in a spirit of complete equality, of respect for the sovereignty of each country over its own natural resources, and of non-intervention in each other's political affairs."
18,1963,MEX,"In view of its importance, I shall quote some of the sentiments expressed on that occasion by the President of Mexico: ""Respect for the rights of others —or what is now known as non-intervention— is a traditional principle of Mexican legal thought."
18,1963,MEX,Considerable progress would be made in this direction if all States could agree on the principle of non-intervention in a formal agreement —including the necessary safeguards to render it effective— to be drawn up within the framework of the United Nations.
18,1963,MEX,"This has always been and still is our firm position, deriving from our profound belief in the essential capacities of man and our unshakable devotion to the principles of self-determination and non-intervention."
18,1963,MEX,"Mexico, as is well known, believes that peace must be based on a regime of freedom and justice; it upholds the legal equality of States and scrupulous respect for their sovereignty; it regards as fundamental the principle that any intervention, whether direct or indirect, and whatever the motive, by one State in the internal or external affairs of another is inadmissible; it whole-heartedly rejects the threat or use of force in international relations; it acknowledges the obligation of States to settle their disputes exclusively by peaceful means; it believes respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms to be essential; it fully supports the right of all peoples to self-determination; and it is firmly convinced that prosperity, like peace, is indivisible and that therefore the economic development of all countries and the betterment of the standard of living of their peoples constitute an inescapable duty of the international community."
18,1963,COL,"Thus the ""gendarme"" State has become the welfare State; untrammelled freedom has given way to intervention in private affairs and finally to socialism, which has gradually prevailed in the constitutional reforms of many States now called democratic."
18,1963,URY,"We trust that the effort of all freemen, wisely and ably supported by the specialized agencies, will triumph finally over aggression, intervention, totalitarianism, subjugation of one people by another, economic exploitation, poverty and ignorance, and that we shall at last make the progress we desire and win prosperity for all mankind."
18,1963,URY,We acknowledge that our international dealings must be founded on the right of people of self-determination and on the principle of non-intervention as a base of reciprocal trust and mutual assistance among the smaller nations.
18,1963,MMR,"My delegation believes that on the whole, the year under review has been a good one for our Organization, While the major role In the Caribbean confrontation had of necessity to be played by the nuclear superpowers, no one can deny that the timely intervention of the United Nations contributed powerfully to taking the edge off the immediate crisis."
18,1963,YEM,"The 1948 Revolution and all the noble ends it represented failed, due to foreign intervention."
18,1963,SDN,"Although I intend to devote the main theme of my intervention to these imperatives, I intend, in the process, to make some short comments on two other closely related categories of imperatives whose challenge to the cause of international harmony is not less ominous."
18,1963,POL,"This is why we are of the opinion that an end should be put, the sooner the better, to foreign intervention in South Viet-Nam."
18,1963,MYS,"I am glad to note, however, that in his intervention yesterday, the representative of the Philippines said: ""Never by word or deed has the Philippine Government expressed any hostility towards Malaysia."
18,1963,MYS,"In the course of his intervention by way of reply, the Ambassador of Indonesia referred to the presence of the colonial authority's troops and police at the hearings by the United Nations ascertainment team."
18,1963,MYS,"In spite of all the steps taken to ascertain the wishes of the people of the two territories, since confirmed by the report of the Secretary-General, it is a matter for regret that the representative of Indonesia, in his second intervention on 30 September 1963 [1221st meeting], permitted himself the statement that Malaya, Sarawak, Sabah and Singapore were forced into Malaysia."
18,1963,LAO,"That agreement, which put an end to fratricidal strife and rivalry, and at the same time to foreign intervention in every form, should have marked the beginning of a new era in the process of building up the nation."
18,1963,BDI,"The United Nations courts destruction if it merely stands by, and, like the League of Nations, looks on at the massacre of a people by an anti-democratic Government, on the pretext of non-intervention, 158."
18,1963,CAN,We felt that intervention in the Congo was a test which this Organization had to accept and a duty which it could not shirk.
18,1963,CAN,"There will, of course, always be some situations in which the United Nations should not be asked to intervene either because the intervention would be outside the Charter, contrary to the Charter, or because it would be beyond the United Nations capacity and therefore bound to fail."
18,1963,CAN,"But there will be other situations where its intervention will be important, perhaps even essential, for keeping the peace, or preventing small conflicts from developing into big ones; for these there surely should be the advance international planning and preparation without which no national Government would dream of acting."
18,1963,CUB,"One example is the tragedy of the people of Viet-Nam, those victims of United States armed intervention, and another is the insatiable economic cartels, whose intrigues to secure positions of advantage in the exploitation of peoples aggravate already dangerous areas of tension."
18,1963,CUB,"The insincerity of United States policy, its deceitfulness and lack of respect for principles which it constantly claims to be upholding can perhaps be best observed in Latin America where traditionally United States aggression has made itself felt through armed intervention, wanton exploitation of natural resources, control of external trade and many of the public services,."
18,1963,CUB,"That is why the Cuban delegation to the United Nations calls upon all States, especially the African and other States here represented whose peoples are struggling to affirm their political and economic independence, even as they justly condemn South Africa's policy of apartheid and such cruel manifestations of colonialist oppression as in the case of Angola, to condemn with equal vigour the criminal intervention in the Republic of Viet-Nam and other neo-colonialist activities which actually frustrate all efforts now being made on behalf of world peace."
18,1963,NOR,"As was mentioned by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden in his intervention on 1 October 1963, the Foreign Ministers of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Sweden and Norway were recently invited by the Government of South Africa to visit that country and to acquaint themselves with South African conditions."
18,1963,BGR,"If the United Nations is to remain faithful to its original mission, the principles underlying its Charter must be complied with: the sovereign equality of all States and respect for their territorial integrity and national independence; prohibition of the threat or use of force in international relations; non-intervention in the internal affairs of States, and a whole series of other principles, all designed to further the active and constructive development of friendly relations among nations."
18,1963,PHL,"More broadly, our choice was between a decision that would have made us a party to the act of confrontation, and a decision which enables us to help in moderating an explosive situation and discouraging outside intervention that could make South-East Asia the cockpit of a new war."
18,1963,THA,"On the contrary, military clashes continue to take place in Laos with the active penetration and intervention from its aggressive and expansionist eastern neighbours."
18,1963,THA,"It will rather supplement the role of the Secretary-General, whose good offices and intervention will always be needed in more delicate situations where what is known as ""quiet diplomacy"" is particularly suitable."
18,1963,TUR,"The United Nations Charter, taking cognizance of this fact, enunciates the basic principles by which Member States are to be guided in their international relations: fidelity to their undertakings, respect for the rights and the territorial integrity of other nations, the will to live in peace with neighbouring countries, non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States, the settlement of disputes by peaceful means, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
18,1963,ZAF,"In this connexion, mention was made of the continuation of ideological conflicts, with attempts by States to dominate and indoctrinate the minds of men, as well as intervention by States, in the prosecution of their ideological campaigns, in the domestic affairs of others under the guise of morality or service to humanity."
18,1963,ZAF,"As I have already indicated in a previous intervention, many of the Governments represented here are violently opposed to the doctrines according to which other Governments deal with their domestic affairs."
18,1963,ZAF,"These parts read as follows: ""The General Assembly, ""… ""Condemning the intervention of a State in the internal affairs of another State for the purpose of changing its legally established government by the threat or use of force,""1."
18,1963,VEN,This has been our practice and we do not regard it as constituting intervention in the affairs of the States whose de facto Governments we do not recognize.
18,1963,RUS,The Soviet people succeeded in upholding their honour and freedom when they had to fight in the years of civil war and of armed foreign intervention launched by fourteen States.
18,1963,KHM,"Nils Göran Gussing, for their praiseworthy intervention in the Khmer-Thailand dispute."
18,1963,KHM,"As Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Head of the Khmer State, observed from this very rostrum in 1961, ""the ideal solution"" to this paradoxical situation ""would undoubtedly be that each of these peoples should be reunified through a general referendum organized and supervised by the United Nations, without intervention from the Government of either part of the divided country, since each such Government is aligned with one of the blocs originally responsible for the division"" [1011th meeting, para."
37,1982,JAM,"The current session of the  General Assembly is being held against the background of an alarming  deterioration of the international situation, characterized by global  confrontation, military intervention, foreign occupation, a spiraling  of the arms race, and the frequent resort to the use or threat of the  use of force against the sovereignty, political independence and  territorial integrity of States all of this in the midst of a deep  global economic recession."
37,1982,HND,"But Honduras ardently desires to help bring  about stability and harmony, in keeping with its devotion to the  principles of non intervention and self determination, and to help  Central America to become a region of peaceful coexistence, whose  people and leaders will establish and maintain understanding on the  basis of effective dialogue."
37,1982,ARE,The Government of my country has repeatedly  condemned the foreign intervention in Afghanistan  as a flagrant violation of the Charter and as an  act of aggression against human rights and the  freedom of peoples.
37,1982,MDG,"Leaving aside  the fact that this would constitute a flagrant  intervention in the internal affairs of a  sovereign independent State, this proposed link  is truly surprising."
37,1982,COD,In Afghanistan the foreign intervention and  occupation is continuing.

37,1982,LBY,"The present Government of the United  States of America is increasing its acts of  intervention and pressure for the purpose of  achieving political, economic and military  hegemony."
37,1982,LBY,"In addition to these negative  developments in the field of disarmament, in  recent years we have witnessed a deterioration in  international relations as a result of the  violation of the Charter and international  principles, in particular those relating to the  right to sovereignty, independence,  non-intervention and the non-use of force in  international relations and the continued spread  of the areas of war and hotbeds of tension."
37,1982,LBY,"One of the regions that experience  tension as a result of intervention and the  installation of foreign bases is Central America,  where the people of Nicaragua are struggling  against the intervention of the United States of  America, which has been training hostile elements  and sending them to Nicaragua to carry out acts  of terrorism and subversion."
37,1982,SUR,"In this respect, we reiterate our full  commitment to the basic principles of this movement, such as national  sovereignty, self determination, non interference, non intervention,  the settlement of disputes by peaceful means and the acceptance of  ideological pluralism in international affairs."

37,1982,CHL,"The tense and unstable situation now  prevailing in the Korean peninsula confirms our  conviction that inter-Korean negotiations are the  only practical way of resolving through peaceful  means and without foreign intervention, a problem  that has been dragging on for almost 40 years."
37,1982,VNM,"It has  decided to deploy medium-range missiles in  Western Europe, shamelessly proclaimed the  doctrine of a for limited nuclear warfare ,  introduced the rapid deployment force into the  region of the Persian Gulf, reinforced its fleet  in the Caribbean Sea and built new military bases  in the Indian Ocean, with a view to preparing for  aggression and intervention in every continent,  thus creating new hotbeds of tension in various  regions of the globe."
37,1982,VNM,We totally support the struggle of the  people of Seychelles and of Madagascar against  imperialist subversion and intervention.
37,1982,VNM,"We are of the view that at this juncture,  when the burdens of the economic crisis and of  the arms race are weighing so heavily on the  developing coun¬tries and when the United States  is resorting to its policy of embargo and  economic sanctions to impose its will on other  peoples, the struggle of the peoples of Asia,  Africa and Latin America to build a new  international economic order is of necessity  linked with the common struggle of the peoples of  the world for peace and disarmament and against  the imperialist policy of aggression and  intervention."
37,1982,LUX,"Logically  the Helsinki document refers to the necessity for  each State to abstain from any intervention,  direct or indirect, in the internal or external  affairs falling within the national competence of  another State, whatever their mutual relations  may be."
37,1982,LUX,"The main  responsibility for these two conflicts tails to a super-Power, whether it  is guilty of direct intervention, as in  Afghanistan, or indirect intervention, as in  Kampuchea."
37,1982,BLZ,Our foreign policy is rooted in certain  cardinal principles of international behaviour:  non-intervention in the internal affairs of  States; the inalienable right of peoples to  self-determination; and the strict observance of  the non-use of force in the settlement of  international disputes.
37,1982,BLZ,"The social unrest and tension in this part of the  world are, in many ways, products of a long  history of exploitation and abuses of human  rights, aggravated by external pressures and  disregard of the principles of non-intervention  and non-interference."

37,1982,CRI,"To some extent the peoples of the world are being deceived when they  disregard the United Nations in the frontal assault on war, guerrilla  warfare, terrorism, torture and foreign intervention in the internal  affairs of States."
37,1982,CRI,"This  other form of totalitarianism, bolstered by open intervention by  forces outside the Central American area, has only sharpened the  conflict, polarized political ideas and created new formidable  obstacles to democratic, representative and pluralistic government  devoted to social justice, without the need for the bloodshed and  confrontation now rending the peoples of the Central American nations  apart."
37,1982,CRI,"it is essential for a peace plan that each country, in the  region and outside of it, carry out the following actions: first, to  create and maintain institutions of government which are truly  democratic, based on the popular will as expressed in free and  untainted elections, based on the principle that the Government is  responsible to the governed; secondly, to respect human rights,  especially the right to life and security of person, and fundamental  freedoms, freedom of expression, information, assembly and worship,  and the right to organize political parties, labor unions and other  groups and associations; thirdly, to foster national reconciliation  wherever profound divisions within society have occurred, by  extending opportunities to participate within the framework of  democratic institutions and procedures; fourthly, to respect the  principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States and  the right of peoples to self-determination; fifthly, to prevent the  use of the territory of a country to support, supply, train or  supervise terrorists or subversive elements acting in other States,  putting an end to the traffic in weapons and materials, and  refraining from direct or indirect support for terrorists or  subversive or other activities designed to bring about the violent  overthrow of the Government of another State; sixthly, to limit  weapons and the scale of military and security forces to levels which  are strictly necessary for the maintenance of public order and  national defense; seventhly, to ensure, in accordance with reciprocal  and fully verifiable terms, international control of all ports of  entry and other border areas which are of strategic importance;  eighthly, to effect withdrawal, on a fully reciprocal basis, from the  Central American area of all foreign military and security advisors  and personnel, and the banning of imports of heavy weapons of an  obviously offensive nature in accordance with procedures which ensure  proper verification."
37,1982,AUT,"The Secretary-General can count on the  full support of Austria in the implementation of  his proposals, in particular those concerning the  preventive intervention of the Security Council  in the early stages of international crises and a  more forthright role for the Secretary-General."
37,1982,AUT,"Austria continues to be concerned about  the fate of the Cambodian people, which has  suffered both tremendous human rights violations  and foreign intervention."

37,1982,IND,"The non-aligned nations know perfectly well that military alliances and interlocking arrangements do not guarantee peace and stability, but on the contrary, serve as a potential invitation to intervention and involvement in strategic conflicts."

37,1982,MMR,Tension  sharpened and escalated fighting led to direct  military intervention in Lebanon.
37,1982,MMR,"The delegation of Burma has had occasion  at previous sessions of the General Assembly to  voice its regret and deep concern over the  occurrence of armed intervention, which obviously  cannot be justified or condoned, in both  situations."
37,1982,MMR,"It was in this spirit that the delegation of  Burma gave its support to the resolutions of the  General Assembly which called for the withdrawal  'or' 'all foreign troops from Kampuchea and  Afghanistan and for"" strict observance by outside  Powers of the principles of non-interference and  non-intervention."
37,1982,BFA,"The Upper Volta is increasingly concerned by the  magnitude of that confrontation, which, if not  soon honorably resolved may lead to foreign  intervention, thus endangering international  security."
37,1982,FRA,We hoped for and proposed the  intervention of United Nations forces.
37,1982,FRA,"This can be  achieved through the following means: a very  substantial increase in the size and resources of  the International Monetary Fund [/MF] to enable  it to assume its role of supporting countries  caught in the grip of financial difficulties and  recover its fundamental role of monitoring  monetary policies and rates of exchange;  systematic intervention by the Bank for  International Settlements in the solution of  financial crises; early implementation, within  the framework of UNCTAD, of the Common Fund for  Commodities, accompanied by renewed efforts aimed  at reaching commodity agreements together with  effective mean for the stabilization of prices;  estab-lishment of an energy affiliate of the  World Bank or some other comparable system so as  to have avail¬able an instrument appropriate to  the size of the energy investments the developing  countries will have to make in the course of the  coming decade."
37,1982,NIC,"And, in Toronto, on the occasion of  the Joint Meeting of the International Monetary  Fund and the World Bank, our country, on behalf  of Latin America, the Philippines and Spain,  voiced its opposition to intervention by certain  institutions in the system of economic  organization of countries in need of assistance."
37,1982,NIC,We support the  Korean people's just struggle for the peaceful  and democratic reunification of their nation free  from foreign intervention.

37,1982,NIC,"It  encourages the most aggressive sectors of  Honduras and other countries of the region, who  recklessly brag in public about their military  ability to defeat Nicaragua and openly call for  foreign intervention against our country, 271."
37,1982,CHN,"In Latin America, outside  intervention has exacerbated the turmoil in the  Caribbean region."
37,1982,CHN,"They  have openly or covertly subjected other countries  to their aggression, intervention or control by  direct or indirect use or threat of force."
37,1982,BEN,"Armed aggression, military intervention, the occupation of the  territories of other States, the use of mercenaries and open  interference in the internal affairs of other independent States have  become their favourite means of imposing their domination and of  achieving the triumph of their selfish and hegemonistic interests, to  the detriment of the rights of other peoples."
37,1982,YEM,"This resolve reflects the  sincere and profound conviction that it is necessary that peace and  security prevail throughout the world and that we end, once and for  all, all violence, aggression, military threats, hegemony,  intervention and colonialism in any form."

37,1982,YEM,"Therefore it views with  profound concern the continuing state of tension in the Horn of  Africa and calls for the solution of the border problems and of the  historical and political problems between the nations of the area  through negotiations and peaceful means, for the sake of the peoples  of those countries and to prevent any foreign intervention in their  internal affairs under the pretext of providing aid and support to  one party or the other."
37,1982,YEM,"As regards Afghanistan, we reaffirm the right of the Afghan people to  self determination, free from foreign intervention of any form and  from any source."
37,1982,YEM,"We have the patience and  faith to continue our march and to work for reconstruction,  development and fruitful cooperation with all countries of the world  on a basis of equality, good neighborliness, mutual respect and non  intervention in the internal affairs of others, settling ail our  conflicts peacefully, so that everyone can enjoy peace and security  and we can help each other in an atmosphere of sincerity conducive to  the happiness of mankind as a whole."
37,1982,MNG,"Immediately after the victory of the October  Revolution, an armed intervention of 14  capitalist States under the slogan of fight  against the communist threat was launched against  the young Soviet Republic."
37,1982,GAB,"be  desirable that the share of the resources of the  Inter-national Monetary Fund [IMF] allocated for  co-operation for developing countries be granted  on more favourable terms and for the World Bank  to increase Hs loans to those countries, which of  course presupposes a strengthening of its means  of intervention."

37,1982,DOM,"In this instance the Dominican Government did not confine itself to  simple support but expressed its willingness to participate, in  whatever useful way it could, without detriment to the principle of  non-intervention, in any effort to normalize relations between those  two brother countries."
37,1982,DOM,"This position on the part of my Government had already been expressed  in the joint declaration issued in Santo Domingo on 16 August last by  the heads of State of Venezuela, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Belize and  the Dominican Republic, on the express initiative of my Government,  in which those distinguished statesmen ratified their support for the  fundamental principles of international law, which include the  sovereign equality of all countries, respect for their independence  and the territorial integrity, respect for the principle of  non-intervention, non recourse to threats or use of force to resolve  international conflicts, ideological pluralism, the  self-determination of nations and respect for and faithful compliance  with international treaties."
37,1982,GTM,"From experience we have learned that if we do not take the  making of our own history into our own hands, others will do it for  us in their own way, which implies an ominous fate for a people which  respects itself: intervention."
37,1982,PRT,"The Soviet intervention in Afghanistan,  which so clearly infringes the juridical rules  upon which the United Nations is based, has been  repeatedly condemned in the Assembly and still  gives rise to harsh criticism against the  hegemonic purposes which were behind it."
37,1982,GRD,"The improper  intervention into the negotiation process by the United States,  through its irrelevant demand for the withdrawal of Cuban troops from  Angola as a pre-condition for the granting of independence to  Namibia, is largely responsible for the present impasse."

37,1982,CUB,Reagan's Administration  has rejected dialogue and a negotiated political solution in this  explosive area and is preparing the conditions for an armed  intervention that would prevent a revolutionary triumph in El  Salvador and drown the Nicaraguan revolution in blood.
37,1982,CUB,"The United States Government is engaged in using the armed forces of  Honduras as a spearhead against Nicaragua and the Salvadorian  patriots, with the aim of legalizing a probable direct intervention  by United States forces."
37,1982,CUB,My delegation reiterates its support for the legitimate aspiration of  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to bring about the peaceful  reunification of its homeland for which it is absolutely necessary  that interference in its internal affairs should cease and that the  United States forces of intervention withdraw from the southern part  of the Korean peninsula.
37,1982,CUB,"The recent events in Lebanon, the conflict in the South  Atlantic and continual threats of aggression and armed intervention  in the Caribbean have been dangerously added to the use of economic  pressures as a weapon of political coercion against the  underdeveloped countries that aspire to an independent, honorable  life and seek the path of development."
37,1982,JPN,"I believe that one of the major sources of mutual distrust and tension within today's international community is the tendency for one country, as a means of solving international conflicts, to resort to arms and to impose its will on another country by military intervention."
37,1982,JPN,"Kampuchea continues to be the victim of foreign military intervention, and its people are still denied the right of self-determination."
37,1982,JPN,"Japan once again strongly urges Viet Nam to end its military intervention in Kampuchea and agree to enter into negotiations, thereby responding to international efforts toward a comprehensive political settlement, which would include the withdrawal of all foreign forces and the holding of free elections under the supervision of the United Nations."

37,1982,FJI,Foreign  armed intervention and occupation continue in Afghanistan and  Kampuchea.
37,1982,SLV,"Thus it is that there will be no peace in Central America if the arms  race continues; there will be no peace if the traffic in arms  continues; there will be no peace as long as people continue , to  support armed groups which seek to overthrow established Governments;  there will be no peace if there is no respect for the right of  peoples to self-determination; there will be no peace if people do  not reject overt or covert foreign intervention; there will be no  peace if there is no respect for ideological pluralism; there will be  no peace if unfair social and economic structures are not eliminated;  there will be no peace if democratic institutions are not  strengthened and if human rights are not fully exercised."
37,1982,SLV,"In other words, Lebanon should be allowed to exercise all  the attributes of a sovereign State, capable of rejecting foreign  intervention or occupation."
37,1982,SLV,"So long as the Afghan people is unable to determine its  own future, free from the flagrant intervention represented by the  presence of almost 100,000 Soviet soldiers, in violation of the most  basic principles of the Charter, there will be no just political  solution."
37,1982,SLV,I do not need to say that in giving  such situations that artificial character the interventionist  interests at work violate the principle of non-intervention in the  internal or external affairs of other States.
37,1982,DDR,The methods employed range from  direct intervention and economic and political  pressure to the setting up of a so-called  coali¬tion Government ' outside the country.
37,1982,COG,It also means that there must be no foreign intervention.
37,1982,GUY,"They  range from the crisis in the multilateral  approach in international affairs to the  proliferation of armaments with the concomitant  incentive and urge to utilize them; the collapse  of cooperative endeavors evolved in the aftermath  of the Second World War so called; an increasing  disregard for the fundamental norms and  principles of international law; and a widespread  tendency  too widespread to resort to lawless  conduct based on confrontation, threats and  violence and, unhappily, intervention."
37,1982,GUY,The proscribing of intervention is at  the core of several international instruments  adopted by this world body over the years.
37,1982,GUY,The motivation for intervention varies from case  to case.
37,1982,GUY,"Further, intervention is of times  designed to frustrate national liberation and the  struggle against colonialism."
37,1982,GUY,"But even as we resolve to banish intervention as  an instrument of policy in relations among  States, it becomes imperative to strengthen and  advance the process of collective security and  disarmament."
37,1982,GUY,Threats of  destabilization and armed intervention are mad in  relation to Central America and the Caribbean.
37,1982,GUY,"As we  speak out against intervention and interference,  the nonaligned are aware that external efforts to  divide and subvert us will continue."
37,1982,PAN,Everything is ripe for a conflagration  which could involve the entire region and be a  pretext for open intervention by outside Powers  and an international conflict of enormous  proportions and complexity.
37,1982,PAN,The  Panamanitm Government does not justify or excuse  any action by East or West against the right to  self-determination and the principles of  non-intervention in the internal affairs of other  States and respect for the sovereignty and  territorial integrity of all States.

37,1982,ESP,"We  consider it necessary to design a pattern of  solutions based on a number of basic ideas, which  in our judgement could be the following:  rejection of so-called military solutions, which  lack effectiveness; reliance on political  negotiations involving all national forces; an  appeal to the principle of non-intervention,  which must be applied strictly in Latin America  to ensure that each people can determine its own  fate; a willingness to assist in the  consolidation of democratic and pluralistic  alternatives, convinced of the need to organize  peaceful coexistence on the basis of a respect  for life and freedom and the requirements of  social justice; and unequivocal and  indiscriminate condemnation of the violation of  human rights, without any territorial or  ideological exceptions."
37,1982,ESP,"Despite the  existence of some positive elements, such as the  recovery of the whole of the Sinai by Egypt,  other developments, such as the illegal  annexation of the Golan Heights and, more  recently, the brutal armed intervention by Israel  in Lebanon, with its consequent tragedies, have  posed a constant challenge to the international  community and have seriously disturbed the  conscience of mankind."

37,1982,OMN,It condemns the acts of  aggression against the Somali sister State and  demands an end to foreign intervention in the  internal affairs of that region lest it should  fall victim to foreign expansionism and attempts  to propagate social systems imported from abroad;  foisting them upon the people of the area with a  view to exploiting their resources.
37,1982,OMN,"It hopes that this  Declaration, which emphasizes respect for this  important principle, will be complied with, thus  guaranteeing the right of all peoples to shape  their own destinies and choose their systems of  government without any outside intervention,  pressure or threat."
37,1982,SDN,"The Sudan firmly believes in the  principles of respect for the sovereignty and  independence of all countries and peoples, the  illegality of intervention in all its forms in  internal affairs, the inadmissibility of the use  or threat of use of force in international  relations and the necessity of halting all forms  of aggression and pressure—covert or overt—that  threaten the sovereignty and political  independence of other countries."
37,1982,SDN,"We reiterate our call for the  withdrawal of all foreign troops so that the  peoples of those two countries can exercise their  inalienable right to decide on the politi¬cal,  social and economic systems they deem fit for  their countries, without foreign intervention or  domi¬nation."

37,1982,UGA,"The year 1982 has been characterized by an increase in  armed conflicts, escalation if the arms race, the persistence of  potentially explosive territorial disputes; lingering colonialism and  foreign interference and intervention."
37,1982,AFG,"Their  interference in the affairs of sovereign States  is being expanded, special forces are being set  up for armed intervention, their military  presence in various parts of the world is being  increased old bases are being modernized and new  ones are being established."
37,1982,EGY,"We consider it our duty to  call for adherence to the charter of the OAU,  which forbids intervention in the internal  affairs of member States."

37,1982,PAK,"In our neighbourhood, the crisis in Afghanistan resulting  from Soviet military intervention in that country nearly three years  ago persists, with no sign of reprieve in its severity."
37,1982,PAK,"The latest  expression of this international concern was embodied in general  Assembly resolution 36/34, adopted last year with the overwhelming  support of 116 Member States, which outlined, once again, the  essential elements of a just political solution of the Afghanistan  problem, namely, the immediate withdrawal of the foreign troops from  Afghanistan, the preservation of the sovereignty, territorial  integrity, political independence and non-aligned character of  Afghanistan, the right of the Afghan people to determine its own form  of government and to choose its economic, political and social system  free from outside intervention, subversion, coercion or constraint of  any kind whatsoever, and the creation of necessary conditions which  would enable the Afghan refugees to return voluntarily to their homes  in safety and honour."
37,1982,PAK,"Accordingly, Pakistan supports the right of the people of  Kampuchea to shape their own future free from outside intervention  and has joined the international call for the withdrawal of foreign  troops from that unfortunate and Pakistan welcomes the formation of a  coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, headed by Prince  Sihanouk and hopes that this Government will facilitate the creation  of conditions conducive to the full implementation of the decisions  of the general  Assembly on the Kampuchean question."
37,1982,LAO,"Quite the  contrary, the longer it goes on, the more  conditions favorable to the intervention and  interference of imperialism in the region it will  create."
37,1982,LAO,This will create  a dangerous precedent for foreign intervention  against inde¬pendent and sovereign nations and  violate the principles of the Charter of the  United Nations and the non-aligned movement.
37,1982,SYR,It is our opinion that the Afghan  Government has the right to defend the  independence of Afghanistan against all types of  outside intervention in its internal affairs.
37,1982,YUG,"To this end,  bloc policy resorts to the use of the most  diverse methods of destabilization, ranging from  interference in internal affairs and economic  pressure to military intervention and direct  aggression."
37,1982,YUG,The peoples  of Afghan¬istan and Kampuchea are prevented from  exercising their right to a free life and are  still subjected to foreign intervention.
37,1982,YUG,"The  international community has, through United  Nations resolutions and the positions taken by  the conferences of the non-aligned countries,  laid down the basis for a peaceful political  solution of these problems, which can be achieved  only through the withdrawal of foreign troops and  the elimination of all forms of outside  intervention."
37,1982,BWA,Botswana  does not accept the use of armed intervention to  enforce territorial claims.
37,1982,PER,"In Central America there is a growing  tendency towards confrontation, and the  considerable difficulties faced by the peoples  of the area are compounded by forms of foreign  intervention, political polarization and internal  and external armed struggle."
37,1982,PER,"We have made clear our rejection of  intervention in and military use of the territory  of Lebanon^ in violation of its indepen-dence and  sovereignty, the persistence of policies of force  and the commission of genocidal crimes against  the Palestinian people."
37,1982,GMB,"In the same region, the illegal occupation of Afghanistan by some  100,000 foreign troops has persisted, in violation of the cardinal  principles of self- determination and non-intervention, and in  defiance of the clear will of the international community in general  and the Moslem world in particular."
37,1982,YMD,"Its policy towards its neighbors is founded on good-neighborliness, respect for national sovereignty and non-intervention in their internal affairs, as well as peaceful coexistence between the various social systems."
37,1982,YMD,"Many areas of Asia, Africa and Latin America remain the subject of imperialist threats and intervention, and suffer from the remnants of imperialism and every form of persecution, oppression and racial discrimination."
37,1982,YMD,My country also supports the efforts of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and its proposals for establishing security and stability in South-West Asia without any intervention in the internal affairs of Afghanistan.
37,1982,YMD,"Democratic Yemen condemns the policy of aggression and intervention, as well as the imperialist and colonial pressures used by the United States Government against the peoples of Cuba, Nicaragua and Grenada, in an attempt to destabilize those States."
37,1982,RUS,"Only one thing is required, and that is to stop the armed intervention from outside against Afghanistan and not interfere in the internal affairs of that sovereign non-aligned State."
37,1982,ZWE,"With regard to Cyprus, Zimbabwe would again want to see the end to all forms of foreign intervention and interference, so that the people of that republic may be able to determine their own future freely."
37,1982,ZWE,"Our own view is that it is only the people of that country free of external pressure, intervention and interference who can resolve their internal problems."
37,1982,ZWE,For that reason we find unacceptable Indonesia's military intervention in East Timor.
37,1982,BLR,Detente is a  conscientious observance in good faith of the norms of international  law and the principle of non intervention in the internal affairs of  others.

37,1982,BHR,"The six member States have agreed in the  Charter of the Council to abide by their obligations under the  Charter of the United Nations, to act together to preserve peace,  security and stability in the region without foreign intervention,  and to develop political, economic, cultural and social relations  among themselves and with other States in the world for their benefit  and that of the world as a whole."
37,1982,BHR,"Faithful to the principle of non-intervention in the domestic  affairs of States, the State of Bahrain has called for an end to the  Soviet intervention in Afghanistan."
37,1982,BHR,"We are still convinced that there should be a political  solution to this question in accordance with the United Nations  resolutions that ca)) for the withdrawal of foreign forces from  Afghanistan, for respect for Its sovereignty, independence and  non-aligned status and for respect for the right of the people of  Afghanistan freely to choose their political, economic and social  system free from any foreign intervention in their domestic affairs."
37,1982,BHR,We hope  these will lead to the establishment of peace and security under a  unified State free from any foreign intervention.
37,1982,IRN,"We consider necessary the complete, unconditional and  immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces from Afghanistan,  non-intervention by other forces in the internal affairs of that  country, the return of the Afghan combatants to their homeland and  the restoration to the people of Afghanistan of their right to  determine their destiny; without these, there can be no settlement of  the Afghanistan issue."
37,1982,KWT,"Kuwait views with great concern the  ongoing war between two Moslem neighbors, Iraq  and Iran, which has exhausted, over a period of  more than two years, the great potential of their  human and economic resources and has exposed the  area more than ever before to the possibility of  intervention by foreign Powers attempting to  impost their hege¬mony and their influence and to  international areas and internal affairs."
37,1982,KWT,"While we appreciate the  par¬ticipation of the parties to the dispute in  the meeting recently held at Geneva under the  aegis of the United Nations, we call for an  intensification of efforts at subsequent meetings  in order to arrive at a solution that will  safeguard the rights of the people of Afghanistan  to self-determination and to establish the  political system they deem suitable, free from  any foreign intervention."
37,1982,KWT,Kuwait is con¬vinced that none of these  goals can be secured without the withdrawal of  foreign troops from Afghanistan and  non-intervention in its internal affairs.
37,1982,MRT,"This cursory survey of the burning  problems in our continent reminds us that Africa,  which in the past suffered the terrible  exploitation of its human and material resources,  and which is now the target of imperialist  appetites and intervention, needs, more than ever  before, the cohesion of all the countries which  make it up."
37,1982,ETH,"Despite the adoption by the General Assembly of  the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of  Peace, the expansion or modernization of existing  military bases and the acquisition of new ones in  the area, as well as the deployment of rapid  intervention forces and weapons of mass  destruction, are being highly intensified."
37,1982,BGD,We should do  everything possible to ensure the withdrawal of all foreign troops  from those two countries and to ensure that the people in both those  countries are permitted to determine their own destinies without any  outside intervention or interference.
37,1982,DZA,"This activism was  reflected, by obstacles being increasingly  placed in the way of the national liberation  struggle of the peoples, an increase in policies  of intervention and destabilization, the  reactivation and opening of military bases and a  frantic search for military facilities for  interventionist purposes."
37,1982,ALB,"United States interference in Iran and  the stationing of its aggressive military forces  in the Middle East, the occupation of Afghanistan  by the Soviet Union, the incitement of conflicts  on the African continent, intervention in Latin  America and Southeast Asia along with the  political, economic and military threats and  blackmail in regard to many countries by the two  super-Powers, all go to show that they are  pursuing a policy of oppression and aggression."
37,1982,AGO,"Ever since the thirtieth session of the general Assembly the  Organization has been expressing deep concern over the situation  obtaining in East Timor as a result of the intervention of Indonesian  armed forces and has been requesting the Indonesian Government to  withdraw without delay its forces from the Territory in order to  enable the people of East Timor freely to exercise their right to  self-determination and independence, as provided in general Assembly  resolution 3485 (XXX)."

37,1982,MDV,"My delegation  reiterates its policy of endorsing the United Nations resolutions  which condemn foreign intervention and call for the withdrawal of  foreign forces from those two countries, allowing the peoples of  Afghanistan and Kampuchea the opportunity to exercise their own  rights without outside influence or pressure, including the right of  refugees to return to their homes in safety and honor."
37,1982,MDV,"In the same context and within the framework of the same  principles involved, we look at the events in Africa and Latin  America in which intervention in the internal affairs of countries  took place under different pretexts in the past few years."
37,1982,MDV,"My country  is deeply concerned over this trend of military intervention, which  undermines the orderly and peaceful existence of nations."
37,1982,ECU,"To face up to those perspectives, Ecuador  comes to this new session to reaffirm its  position of adherence to the basic principles of  its international policy, outstanding among which  are those relating to the sovereign equality of  States, non-intervention, the rejection of the  threat or use of force in international  relations, the non-recognition of territorial  conquests obtained by force, the peaceful  settlement of disputes, international  co-operation, respect for human rights, and the  rejection of racial discrimination, apartheid,  colonialism and neo colonialism."
37,1982,COL,We cannot countenance the illegal occupation and  annexation of territories by force or other forms of intervention  that perpetuate a state of permanent anxiety.
37,1982,COL,"The all-out free  enterprise of the so-called Chicago school on the one hand and the  rigid self- management and planning, with total State intervention,  advocated by the current Marxist school, on the other, are the most  recent examples of how blind adherence to economic theories whose  origins are purely political is doomed to failure."
37,1982,PRY,"Thus we repudiate and forcefully condemn the Soviet Union's  subjugation of the sovereignty of Afghanistan, a country which is  steadfastly struggling to defend its independence; we repudiate with  equal force Viet Nam's intervention in Kampuchea; and we cannot fail  to condemn the brutal genocide carried out against defenseless  communities in Lebanon."
33,1978,TZA,"The continued occupation of Arab lands, the denial of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the escalation of violence and civil strife in Lebanon, compounded by Israeli intervention there, have made the situation in the region even more explosive."
33,1978,KHM,"The OAU Assembly held in Khartoum last July reflected the common will of the 400 million Africans to prevent all intervention and interference on the part of the expansionist and imperialist big Powers and their followers, and to be responsible for their own destiny."
33,1978,KHM,"At present, if Kampuchea can be self-sufficient in food, develop through its own means and struggle successfully against the intervention and aggression of its enemies of all kinds and especially against the Vietnamese aggressor, which is annexationist and a swallower of territories,  it is again thanks to the active participation in the revolution of the people as a whole."
33,1978,KHM,"The Government of the Democratic People's Re public of Korea, under the leadership of President Kim H Sung, proposed certain reasonable measures to solve the Korean; problem independently and peacefully, without foreign intervention."
33,1978,GMB,In Africa we have witnessed in the last year or so a spate of foreign military intervention and adventurism reminiscent of the nineteenth century imperialist expansion into our continent.
33,1978,GMB,"We are categorically opposed to all forms of military intervention, whatever their origin and motivation."
33,1978,GMB,"After centuries of struggle for freedom and against foreign domination, resulting in an almost total liberation of the continent and the demise of imperialism in its classical form, Africa cannot accept any foreign military intervention, even in its present guise."
33,1978,GMB,Africa does not need at this time of its development military intervention or the kind of aid which would escalate internecine conflicts and accelerate self-destruction.
33,1978,GMB,What Africa needs urgently is foreign economic intervention along lines conceived by Africans and for the primary benefit of our peoples.
33,1978,VEN,"Although the text of their communication is already an official document of this Assembly, I shall conclude my statement by reading out one of its paragraphs: ""In denouncing the tragic and dramatic situation of vast segments of the population of Nicaragua, whose essential rights are being violated, we respect the principle of non-intervention, which is by no means incompatible with the task of internationally safeguarding human rights which the United Nations is required to perform, as is the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, there being no objection to simultaneous action by these two bodies since the United Nations is not required consider the political case submitted to the jurisdiction of the regional organization but to take action in defence of human rights which, as we understand it, is an inescapable obligation of the agencies responsible for ensuring full respect for those rights."
33,1978,ETH,"Their strategy varies from direct military intervention to covert subversion, from open interference in the internal affairs of others to subtle psychological warfare."
33,1978,ETH,"Imperialism, which, as the instigator of counter-revolution and the provider of its arsenal, has for years with impunity been rushing its marines, special units, agents, legionnaires and mercenaries into the different parts of the globe to crush popular uprisings and prop up corrupt and decadent regimes, has started to cry ""foreign intervention"" in Africa."
33,1978,ETH,"Viewed against this background, the hue and cry over alleged Soviet and Cuban intervention in the Morn of Africa is, to say the least, hypocritical."
33,1978,ETH,Those repeated acts of armed intervention are designed to destabilize the Governments in the region and convert the area into a safe haven for exploitation and racial domination.
33,1978,ETH,"It is gratifying to note that the courageous peoples of Viet Nam and Laos, who for decades heroically struggled against the crudest form of imperialist intervention and domination, have now embarked on the heavy task of socialist reconstruction."
33,1978,ETH,"The Government of the United States, which has made itself the self-appointed policeman of the world and the ""custodian"" of human rights, is never tired of pontificating over alleged foreign intervention in Africa."
33,1978,ETH,"The massive military build-up and the intensification of the arms race by the imperialist Powers and reactionary forces are not limited to the confines of Europe, where the alleged Soviet threat provides a convenient smoke-screen, but are being extended to Africa, where attempts are made at frustrating the struggle of the African people against exploitation, domination and human degradation by hysterical and hypocritical cries of Soviet intervention in Africa."
33,1978,HUN,"We regard it as being of great importance that the non-aligned countries are taking a stand against the use of force, armaments and intervention in the ""internal affairs of other countries, as well as for peace and security."
33,1978,ITA,"We are all aware of the existence of grave situations in Which regional instability, and sometimes open conflict, ate the result of the internal difficulties of newly independent countries coupled with massive foreign intervention."
33,1978,ITA,"Perhaps certain tense situations would not have reached the breaking-point without the prospect, unfortunately well grounded, of such intervention."
33,1978,ITA,"Indeed, it is obvious that solutions based only on the intervention of military forces generate situations in which crises are bound to explode again."
33,1978,STP,Those intimidating manoeuvres were intended to create a climate propitious for future intervention by mercenaries.
33,1978,CAF,"It is for changes corresponding to the needs of such times that the Central African Empire since its inception has worked and intends to work, along with all the States of the world which love peace and justice, in order to maintain relations based on the strict principles of non- alignment, self-determination, non-intervention, reciprocal equality and the peaceful settlement of disputes, thus contributing to the establishment of a new international economic order."
33,1978,LBY,"In fulfilment of its responsibilities to the international community as a whole, the peoples of Africa, the Arab homeland and the third world in particular, it cannot but face the truth and state in all candour its opinion that the deteriorating situation in the African continent is a result, as is apparent to all, of the recent direct acts of colonialist intervention and the existence of racist regimes which perpetrate acts of aggression against the peoples of that continent and continue to violate the principles of this Organization and its Charter and to disregard human rights, in pursuit of racist policies."
33,1978,LBY,"However, that prompted imperialism and colonialism to attempt to re-impose their domination and control by resorting to unethical means, ranging from the political assassination of African leaders to the use of white mercenaries to overthrow progressive Governments—whose only crime was trying to raise the standard of their peoples and to pursue a policy that served the interests of their peoples—and ending with military intervention and with the use of armed force in order to re-impose colonialism on the peoples of the continent."
33,1978,LBY,Such attempts by the colonialist Powers or their direct military intervention in the continent will only increase the determination of our peoples in Africa to fight until the last bastions of colonialism and colonialist monopolies vanish.
33,1978,LBY,"In this respect, we can only acknowledge the great efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea, free from foreign intervention, and the removal of the colonialist American force, which is an obstacle in the way of Korean unity."
33,1978,SDN,"The Khartoum meeting signifies a commitment on our part to preserve our sovereignty, which we forcefully retrieved, and to close the door against foreign intervention, emphasizing a declaration of unwavering determination to repel any danger threatening our countries, our peoples and our continent."
33,1978,SDN,"Since the awakening of Africa, colonialism has openly resorted to intervention in the internal affairs of the African States in order to safeguard its own interests."
33,1978,SDN,"For that reason, the OAU, realizing that this intervention constitutes a direct threat to the very survival of the African peoples and their systems, has continued to monitor with concern and dismay the deteriorating situation resulting from the increasing foreign intervention in the internal affairs of the continent."
33,1978,SDN,"The Khartoum summit meeting strongly condemned all policies of intervention in African affairs, whatever their source, since such policies would turn the continent into a battlefield, the effect of which would be the destruction of the socio-economic structures, leading ultimately to opening wide the door for the return of the colonialists."
33,1978,NZL,"Or they can meddle, as some States far from Africa have chosen to do in various parts of the continent, by encouraging divisions and even by direct intervention."
33,1978,AGO,"Although we still hope that a just solution will be found within the framework of the OAU, through the work of the ad hoc Committee composed of five Heads of State of the OAU and the holding of a special summit on the question of the Western Sahara'0 we are convinced that it is now necessary, by means of negotiations and with the full participation of the Frente POLISARIO, to face up to the inevitable political solution, so as to safeguard the Saharan people's right to national existence and to preserve the region from foreign intervention."
33,1978,MUS,"The growing tendency towards foreign intervention is highly dangerous, as it threatens the peace and security of Africa."
33,1978,COL,"The two Presidents stated the following: ""In denouncing the tragic and dramatic situation of vast segments of the population of Nicaragua, whose essential rights are being violated, we respect the principle of non-intervention, which is by no means incompatible with the task of internationally safeguarding human rights which the United Nations is required to perform."
33,1978,COL,"The work of international bodies in the field of human rights cannot be regarded as an activity which violates the principle of non-intervention, because whatever work they do is carried out in compliance with their treaty obligations."
33,1978,ECU,"As a basis for its participation in the international community, Ecuador has maintained fundamental principles which are at the very root of our tradition-principles such as that of the legal equality of States and that of non-intervention, which is derived from the former."
33,1978,ECU,"Observing the fundamental principles that inspire the regional system and the United Nations Charter, notably the principles of non-intervention, the peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for human rights, all countries, particularly in the Americas, must give their humanitarian assistance in this crisis, and the parties directly concerned should, by efforts at conciliation, effectively contribute to a solution of the problem-all this within the basic spirit of the resolution recently adopted at the seventeenth meeting of consultation of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Organization of American States."
33,1978,TUN,"The latest manifestation of this conflict is the invasion of southern Lebanon, which the occupation forces refuse to evacuate, despite United Nations resolutions and the intervention of the international Force dispatched by the Security Council, UNIFIL."
33,1978,TUN,"It is not only that the grave problems in the south of the continent have not been solved, but the whole of Africa is today the scene of crises and regional conflicts which have been aggravated in the course of a deliberate process of interference and intervention from outside Africa, both of which unfortunately have done much more to crystallize these problems than to solve them."
33,1978,ROU,"In accordance with its constant position, Romania has held that the African peoples must be allowed to solve their problems themselves, through negotiations and by excluding any outside intervention, and has stressed the particular importance of strengthening the unity and solidarity of the African States, which is an essential prerequisite for the defence and consolidation of their national sovereignty and independence."
33,1978,DZA,"In addition, recent events have not failed to reveal that the true motive of outside intervention in Africa, and of actions directed against the Arab nation is obedience to a tenacious determination to safeguard and consolidate at all costs the last bastions of colonialism and racism and to weaken progressive positions and acquire control over those regions and their resources."
33,1978,DZA,"These efforts at any rate reflect the determination of the third-world countries to and themselves against foreign intervention and manipulation and at the same time to make their full contribution to the search for solutions for the problems of our era, out of a conviction that peace and detente will continue to be precarious as long as their field of application does not encompass all the regions of the world."
33,1978,DZA,"To colonial problems are added those of racial discrimination, apartheid and the intervention of foreign Powers which are seeking to re-establish themselves in our continent and re-conquer lost positions."
33,1978,PHL,The great pity is that naked intervention in other people's affairs could ultimately rob the noble ideal of human rights of any true worth or meaning.
33,1978,FRA,"In view of the crisis provoked by the Israeli intervention in southern Lebanon, my Government decided last March to participate in UNIFIL."
33,1978,YEM,Yet we consider foreign intervention in any form or magnitude to be the constant and major factor underlying the political problems and the military confrontation which befell the Horn of Africa early this year.
33,1978,YEM,"However, our country opposes any intervention in its internal affairs and also adamantly rejects the encouragement of problems among other States."
33,1978,SWE,"But the small States, too, can play an important role in the work for peace, non-intervention, detente and equality."
33,1978,SWE,"For instance, the principle of non-intervention must never be taken to mean a limitation of the right to call attention to breaches of fundamental United Nations principles."
33,1978,BEL,"Out intervention was brief, limited in aim and we were not responsible for the loss of a single life among the local population."
33,1978,MEX,"This is the result of the confidence which reigns in Mexico, both internally and externally and, as we have repeated on numerous occasions in this forum, of our support and respect for the principles of self-determination, non-intervention, sovereign equality and the peaceful settlement of disputes."
33,1978,MMR,"As a consequence, the struggle for strategic strongholds and spheres of influence has once again come to the fore, with a growing tendency towards extraregional intervention, notably in the regions of Africa and Asia."
33,1978,MMR,"The area is one of crisis in which local conflicts tend to become prone to extraregional intervention, with all the elements of power-bloc rivalry."
33,1978,CHL,"We believe that its problems should be solved by the African countries themselves, through their regional organization and without any foreign intervention."
33,1978,CHL,"Therefore, we condemn foreign intervention in Africa or in any other part of the world."
33,1978,CHL,Nor are the nations of Asia and Oceania exempt from foreign intervention.
33,1978,DDR,"Who would not know that this is to substantiate a ""right"" to intervention on what are alleged to be humanitarian grounds and to justify, for example, the creation of the post of a so-called United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights."
33,1978,RUS,"It is not fortuitous that among Asian countries there is a growing realization of the fact that conflicts, crude pressure and interference in internal affairs, which not so long ago went so far as to assume the dimensions of military intervention, and attempts to pit Asian States one against the other should give way to a stable peace."
33,1978,YMD,The Israeli intervention in Lebanon poses a threat to peace and security in the region.
33,1978,YMD,We condemn that intervention and affirm the unity and Arabism of Lebanon.
33,1978,YMD,"Moreover, the security of the area is endangered not only by the expansionist ambitions of certain States and their military intervention in the affairs of smaller States but also by aggressive military pacts."
33,1978,NOR,The principle of non-intervention cannot today be seen as constituting any legal obstacle to such violations being dealt with in international forums.
33,1978,MAR,"During the past year Africa has witnessed what no other continent has witnessed with regard to foreign intervention, because a certain element, in an endeavour to establish a foothold for itself on African territory and seeking to expand its sphere of influence and broaden its authority, has set about inundating some regions of the continent with massive supplies of the latest instrument of ruin, destruction and annihilation and to this end has brought in tens of thousands of foreign troops from overseas and endeavoured to use them and exploit them to destabilize the legitimate regimes which do not act in accordance with its wishes in certain parts of the continent."
33,1978,MAR,"This foreign intervention is being perpetrated in the name of certain ideologies or slogans; but the first task in Africa is to liberate Pretoria and Salisbury from the despotic racist cliques, which do not acknowledge the humanity of Africans, refuse to recognize their status as human beings and trample their dignity under foot."
33,1978,MAR,"secondly, the prohibition of outside intervention, from whatever source and from whatever motives, in African affairs and African disputes, as called for by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU at its fifteenth ordinary session held in Khartoum last July; thirdly, the immediate withdrawal of all non-African forces from the African continent; fourthly, encouragement of the solution of-all African problems by purely African means; fifthly, the promotion and development of means of economic and technical co-operation between African States; and sixthly, assistance to Africa in eliminating and liquidating the racist regimes in Rhodesia, South Africa and Namibia through positive aid consisting of the provision of all types of assistance to the joint African effort to liberate those countries, including support for the front-line States in strengthening their capacity to resist, oppose and confront the acts of military aggression inflicted upon them, and through indirect aid consisting of the strict observance of the application of economic sanctions against the Pretoria and Salisbury regimes and the tightening of the military blockade decided upon by the United Nations."
33,1978,MAR,"As for the sister State of Lebanon, which was the flower of the Arab countries and a centre for fraternization and coexistence between sects and creeds, and which has been linked with Morocco by human and cultural ties since the dawn of history, it is now-following the blatant Israeli aggression to which it has been exposed and the occupation of parts of its territory-become, more than at any time in the past, a target for intervention in its internal affairs and the violation of its sovereignty."
33,1978,HTI,"On many occasions the intervention, in extremis, of international organizations, including the United Nations, has been necessary to avert what was often an almost fatal development, while certain sectors, which have already forgotten the lessons of history, compel mankind to survive by its wits, despite the fact that the danger of a world conflagration of catastrophic dimensions remains undiminished."
33,1978,HTI,"The Republic of Haiti, always faithful to respect for the principles of independence, sovereignty and the territorial integrity of States, and non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, deplores the continued presence of foreign troops on the territory of the Republic of Cyprus."
33,1978,NGA,"I cannot reflect this better than by referring to a portion of the statement which my Head of State, Lieutenant General Olusegun Obasanjo, made at the fifteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] in Khartoum in July of this year: ""Let me at the outset reiterate Nigeria's position on the question of external intervention in the affairs of any sovereign nation."
33,1978,NGA,"""We are, however, of the view that we need to be quite clear about what we mean by external intervention in the context of contemporary political developments in Africa."
33,1978,NGA,"Unless we wish to indulge in self-deception by avoiding unpalatable truths, we should recognize the recent intervention by certain ex-colonial European Powers in Central Africa for what it really was."
33,1978,OMN,"But this can only be achieved, in our opinion, by putting an end to foreign intervention and its harmful impact on the sequence of events in the African continent."
33,1978,OMN,My country regards with grave' anxiety overt intervention in the affairs of the African continent by foreign forces intent on the domination and control of its resources.
33,1978,OMN,"Such foreign intervention does not in any way help to solve existing problems in Africa, but drags Africa into the disputes of the great Powers."
33,1978,OMN,"The African Assembly held recently in Khartoum realized this, namely, that the problems and preoccupations of Africa are the responsibility of Africa, and the OAU at that Assembly, denounced foreign intervention in the African continent, which sows seeds of dissension among the peoples and exploits regional disputes, furthering plans for domination and hegemony over African resources."
33,1978,OMN,"At successive General Assembly sessions, and elsewhere in other international forums, the Sultanate of Oman, a country with a long coastline on the Indian Ocean, has, like other countries, firmly supported and called for the declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace, free of nuclear and strategic weapons, to ensure that that area remains outside the sphere of conflicts among the superpowers, thus ensuring for the countries and peoples of the region stability, peace and security and freedom from foreign intervention and foreign threats."
33,1978,OMN,"The Sultanate of Oman, under the leadership of His Majesty Sultan Qabus—may God preserve his life-extends a hand of sincere friendship and fruitful co-operation to all peoples and countries of the world, regardless of their different economic, social and political systems, on the basis of respect for sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of others."
33,1978,MOZ,But the death of a single white man is sufficient to arouse tremendous agitation and give rise to threats of intervention.
33,1978,MOZ,"In the Middle East, imperialist intervention has gained fresh momentum and divisive manoeuvres are increasing with the clear objective of destroying the liberation movement and the fight for emancipation of the Arab peoples."
33,1978,ALB,As a result of the policy of intervention of the super-Powers a number of disquieting factors have accumulated today in the Balkans; there are problems which hamper the normal development of good-neighbourly relations between the various States in that region; and there still prevail conditions which prevent the Balkan peoples from feeling secure and sheltered from danger.
33,1978,ALB,"The Albanian Government holds that the Balkan people are capable of acting resolutely to bar the way to any intervention, to any intrigue by the imperialist Powers."
33,1978,ALB,"The Albanian Government's view has been and remains that this problem can and must be resolved in a just manner by the people of Cyprus itself, on the basis of its free will and without any foreign intervention."
33,1978,ALB,"In order to befuddle the African peoples and countries as much as possible, the super-Powers make a great show of being the friends of the African peoples and accuse one another of ""intervention"" in Africa or of ""disrupting the balance""."
33,1978,ALB,The Albanian people and the Government of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania express their complete solidarity with the African peoples in their just struggle against brutal intervention by the imperialist Powers in Africa.
33,1978,IRQ,"The Zionist entity has even allowed itself to embark on military intervention in Lebanon, thus obstructing the implementation of further United Nations resolutions and threatening the existence of a united and independent Lebanon."
33,1978,COM,"The prolongation of the crisis though foreign intervention, requires urgent measures by the international community."
33,1978,MLI,"Thus the Comoros have seen unrest with the intervention of mercenaries, those sworn enemies of the continent, the worst of whom have even been put at the head of that afflicted brother State."
33,1978,PAK,"Since last year the world has become a more troubled place: new areas of global tension have emerged as a result of the exacerbation of relations between the two; leading military Powers; disputes among States and internal conflicts are being resolved through [external intervention and recourse to the use of force; the arms race continues unabated and now encompasses most, of the regions of the world; the world economy remains in the grip of an endemic crisis; the rich Nations are in the midst of a protracted recession; most of the poor are on the brink of economic disaster; international co-operation is at an ebb; and pressing global problems have not moved any closer to solution."
33,1978,NER,"But the Final Act of Helsinki will have no value unless its ethic and scope are extended to other, non- European States; in other words, if its signatories, as well as their allies, complete their historic action by prohibiting any intervention or military interference in Africa in particular, whatever the reason or justification."
33,1978,CUB,"A whole campaign of lies was 6rchestrated to try to accuse Cuba of having participated in the events which took place in the Shaba Province in Zaire, but the truth prevailed and it was further proved that it had all been a means to justify intervention by NATO forces."
33,1978,CUB,"Forces of intervention have even been sent, in an attempt to recolonize Africa, and all possibilities for military confrontation between the countries in the area have been enhanced."
33,1978,BWA,"That, in the view of my delegation, raises the entire question of the security of African States and of intervention in African conflicts by extraterritorial forces."
33,1978,DNK,"view, solutions to these problems, must be found on a regional level without intervention from outside."
33,1978,PAN,"The Ministers take note that Panama and the United States have agreed to open the Protocol of the Treaty on the Permanent Neutrality of the Canal to the accession of all countries, and therefore the Ministers decided to call upon all States of the world to accede to the Protocol, to respect the permanent neutrality of the Canal and to strictly observe the principle of non-intervention in Panamanian affairs."
33,1978,PAN,"Panama had defended and will continue to defend at all times the right of people to self-determination and the principle of non-intervention, which are essential elements in the peaceful coexistence of the peoples of the Central American isthmus."
33,1978,PAN,"The respect which civilized Governments have for the principle of self-determination of peoples and non-intervention, as well as their rejection of the use of force, precludes any possible condoning of acts which are at variance with the ethical values and feelings of the Latin-American peoples."
33,1978,GBR,There is a danger of foreign intervention and of embroiling the whole of Africa in a conflict out of all proportion to its original dimensions.
33,1978,GBR,"Armed intervention by the United Kingdom ""."
33,1978,IRL,But the military strength so acquired can arouse distrust in others and can be an instrument for the domination of others or for intervention elsewhere.
33,1978,IRL,"We have always considered that if there is a role for other nations in local or regional conflicts it is ideally exercised not by direct intervention, but on behalf of the international community as a whole as part of a United Nations peace-keeping operation."
33,1978,EGY,"Egypt, led by its President, Anwar El-Sadat, was the first to warn against the deterioration of the situation in Lebanon caused by foreign intervention."
33,1978,BHR,Such conflicts have led to foreign military and political intervention in the internal affairs of African States.
33,1978,CIV,"These Powers justify their military intervention in Africa by the argument that the States concerned requested it, and by the claim that that request was based on the ""inherent right of individual or collective self-defence"" of any Member State subjected to armed aggression, as recognized by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter."
33,1978,CIV,"That is entirely understandable, but what is much less so is that these same Powers reproach others for their intervention, although it is justified by much the same reasons."
33,1978,LKA,The leadership given by that meeting to the peoples of Africa constitutes a firm determination to keep foreign intervention outside the African continent.
33,1978,URY,"Furthermore, it cannot be accepted that human rights can be invoked for political ends, transforming the so-called defence of those rights into an instrument of aggression and intervention, especially when this is promoted by those countries with a record of intolerant and authoritarian international behaviour."
33,1978,MDG,"It is distressing, however, to note that detente has been used as a pretext in order to foster confrontation, in order to justify intervention and interference, which has meant that there has been a real reversal of values which can only be prejudicial to genuine co-operation among States."
33,1978,AFG,"We believe that the parties concerned should settle their differences through peaceful negotiations and understanding in conformity with the principles of the non-aligned movement and the United Nations Charter, and we regard any intervention in that area as an attempt by imperialistic and reactionary forces to dominate the African continent."
33,1978,BEN,"It obstinately insists on maintaining its domination over the world and continuing with the shameless plunder of our wealth, and any desire for genuine independence immediately brings intervention on its part."
33,1978,BEN,They must unite and organize themselves increasingly over a broad front in order to oppose imperialism's policy of war and intervention and must by deeds require imperialism not only to.
33,1978,QAT,"Those negotiations should be held freely with equality of representation, and without foreign intervention, so that eventually an agreement acceptable to the relevant parties could be reached which would achieve independence and territorial integrity for the island and guarantee its non-alignment, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX)."
33,1978,QAT,My Government also welcomes the efforts being exerted to solve the Korean problem by peaceful means free from foreign intervention.
33,1978,KEN,"After a protracted and bitter struggle by the liberation movement, the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO], and the efforts of this body with the assistance and intervention of a group of five Western countries, it appeared that the South African regime was at last prepared to accept reality and to co-operate with the United Nations in ensuring the speedy and unimpeded transfer of power to the people of Namibia."
33,1978,IND,"We have seen that, while such conflicts may sometimes be brought to an end as a result of external intervention, the cessation of hostilities is seldom followed by genuine peace."
33,1978,CYP,Repeated resolutions of the Security Council calling for the cessation of the armed intervention were ignored by Turkey.
33,1978,CYP,"That resolution, which also called for the cessation of the intervention- in Cyprus and for respect for its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, was unanimously endorsed by the Security Council in its resolution 365 (l974)."
33,1978,SOM,"Having failed both at the fifteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU, held at Khartoum and the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non- Aligned Countries, held at Belgrade, to gain sympathy and support for their armed intervention, the super-Power involved and Cuba as its military arm are devising a devious tactical plan against Governments of neighbouring countries in fulfilment of imperialist designs and hegemonistic ambitions."
33,1978,SOM,"The direct intervention of such a Power, with Cuba as its surrogate, in the affairs of the Horn of Africa is the most dangerous example of this recent trend."
33,1978,SOM,My Government has no illusions about the nature of the driving force behind the recent foreign intervention in purely African conflicts.
33,1978,SOM,"The opportunism of the super-Power concerned was clearly illustrated by its intervention, in alliance with other countries, in the Horn of Africa, where those countries had been the very countries which had actively supported the liberation movement of Western Somalia before their abrupt withdrawal of support."
33,1978,SOM,"Commenting on foreign intervention in Africa, my President said: ""Foreign intervention in all its forms and manifestations is inconsistent with the legitimate aspirations of all Africa and the spirit of the OAU Charter, which upholds the inalienable right of all peoples to control their destiny."
33,1978,SOM,It is a sad task for me to express the disappointment and disillusionment felt by my Government over the large-scale foreign military intervention in African affairs.
33,1978,SOM,"In support of its illegal colonial claims, Ethiopia had repeatedly accused Somalia of violating the principles of the OAU Charter and OAU resolutions,-referring in particular to principles of territorial integrity, non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States and the resolutions on the inviolability of frontiers."
73,2018,KNA,It  is my fervent hope that my plea today for international intervention will bring some relief to the people of our region.
73,2018,QAT,"We note that foreign intervention in Libyan affairs further complicates the crisis, prevents the reaching  of the national consensus that is sought by our Libyan brothers and contravenes Security Council resolutions."
73,2018,MDV,Humanitarian intervention is a necessity.
73,2018,GHA,"We no longer want to be the place that requires the intervention of peacekeepers and poverty-fighting non-governmental organizations, no matter how noble their motives."
73,2018,IRN,"In that regard, from the very beginning of the crisis in Syria we have warned against any foreign intervention in the internal affairs  of  that  country and the use of unlawful means, including supporting extremist and terrorist groups, in order to exert pressure on the Government of Syria."
73,2018,DOM,"In the case of our country, local intervention is focused on prevention campaigns and educating our young people by supporting them with training and entrepreneurial opportunities, while also improving the neighbourhoods where they live and recovering public spaces for people to use."
73,2018,MEX,"We will always seek peaceful solutions agreed by the citizens of those countries, in full respect for the principle of non-intervention."

73,2018,VCT,"It  centres  on  a recommitment to the bedrock foundations of the Charter of the United Nations: sovereign equality, non-interference and non-intervention, international peace and security, respect for international law and collective cooperation in solving global problems."
73,2018,VCT,The principles of non-intervention and non-interference are of particular importance to small island developing States.
73,2018,VCT,"Every violation of the principle of non-intervention, wherever it may occur, is an indirect assault on our own survival."
73,2018,VCT,"To be sure, Venezuela has enormous internal sociopolitical challenges, but unwarranted and illegal intervention is certainly counterproductive to the people’s ongoing quest for peace, democracy and liberty."
73,2018,VCT,"Venezuela needs a peace and reconciliation mission, not a campaign of sanctions, subversion  and  threats of armed intervention."
73,2018,AGO,"It is against  this backdrop that many voices are demanding profound reform of the United Nations so that it can better reflect today’s world, where the emergence of new centres of economic and financial power and technological and scientific advances fully justify changes to the Organization’s structures and intervention mechanisms, as well  as the enlargement and reform of the Security Council   to better represent the various geopolitical regions of our planet."
73,2018,EGY,"Egypt fully supports a United Nations-led political solution in those two brother countries and rejects any exploitation as a means to achieve regional intervention or foster an environment for terrorism, extremism and sectarianism."
73,2018,MMR,"I would also like to make it clear that, while the Government is unable to accept this legally dubious intervention by the International Criminal Court, we are fully committed to ensuring accountability where there is concrete evidence of human rights violations committed in Rakhine state."
73,2018,CUB,"It is impossible for the Organization, born of the desire to overcome through dialogue among nations the destruction wrought by an horrific war, to remain silent about the dangers that threaten us all with the exacerbation of local conflicts, wars of aggression disguised as humanitarian intervention, the forceful overthrow  of  sovereign  Governments,   so-called soft coups and interference in other States’ internal affairs — all of which are established behaviours on the part of certain Powers, under a wild range of pretexts."
73,2018,CUB,We reject any direct or indirect intervention executed without the agreement of the legitimate authorities of that country.
73,2018,SWE,"In the very first intervention last week, the Secretary-General outlined the challenges to our world: a deficit of trust and the need to show the added value of international cooperation by delivering on the promise of peace, defending human rights and driving economic and social progress for women and men everywhere."
73,2018,ATG,"We certainly did not authorize military intervention in any way, shape or form."
73,2018,ATG,"In that connection, when  the  General  Assembly  at its seventy-third session once again discusses this matter, we must strongly discourage bellicose talk of military intervention in any State by any other  State or group of States."
73,2018,ATG,The responsibility to protect must not be used as political cover for vigilante action to justify intervention in any country.
73,2018,SAU,"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has worked to unite the Syrian opposition groups so that they can negotiate with the regime and ensure Syria’s security, stability and unity and prevent foreign intervention or any attempt to partition the country."

73,2018,SLV,We stand for respect for the self-determination and sovereignty of the Venezuelan people and condemn any external interference or threats of military intervention.
73,2018,BOL,It should also restore Guantanamo to Cuban sovereignty and refrain from any interference or intervention in its internal affairs.
73,2018,SYR,"Israel has even supported terrorist groups that have operated in southern Syria, protecting them through direct military intervention and launching repeated attacks on Syrian land."
73,2018,URY,"That includes, for example, first, the commitment to the maintenance of peace, international disarmament and security, as well as the participation of our armed forces in peacekeeping operations; second, our country’s firm rejection of terrorism, organized crime and all types of violence and discrimination, which unfortunately are rampant in the world; third, support for the peaceful settlement of disputes  and  for the sovereign equality of States regardless of their geographical size and number of inhabitants; fourth, unimpeded dedication to, and respect for, international law, which is the greatest guarantee for the sovereignty of peoples and their peaceful coexistence; fifth, our unwavering commitment to the promotion and the protection of all human rights; sixth, adherence to relevant notions such as non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States, respect  for  sovereignty  and the self-determination of peoples; and, seventh, the promotion of multilateralism in all its facets, political, economic, cultural, et cetera, as the best way to face the global challenges facing humankind."
73,2018,URY,"From this place, where we can speak about any number of issues of interest to humankind, I wish to conclude my intervention by mentioning one that, humbly, we consider it a priority to address before everyone here."
73,2018,VEN,An attempt has been made to build a   file to justify an international intervention.
73,2018,VEN,Today we know that plans have been made for an international military intervention to control our country.
73,2018,VEN,"Instead, an attempt has been made to focus on  an  alleged migratory  crisis  in  Venezuela  through  a worldwide media campaign to justify  what  has  been announced for several years — a humanitarian intervention."
73,2018,VEN,"Through their involvement, they sought to create chaos in our homeland and to leave the entire State leaderless in order to justify national confrontation and internal violence, thereby rationalizing the implementation of mechanisms outside the multilateral system of the United Nations and military intervention, as other countries have experienced in the past."
73,2018,NIC,We have condemned the assassination attempt against President Nicolás Maduro Moros and the threat of military intervention against the Bolivarian people and Republic of Venezuela.
73,2018,SWZ,"States Members of the United Nations are strongly urged to avoid fuelling tensions in troubled countries with a divided approach to intervention, as that defeats the purpose of the establishment of the United Nations."
20,1965,LBY,"Today more than ever we feel that the existence of the United Nations is essential for the good of mankind and we must give it all the means it requires to establish and maintain universal peace and to settle international disputes by peaceful means, with due regard for the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States, respect for the sovereignty of States and the right to self-determination."
20,1965,EGY,"Consequently, it is our view that the principle of non-intervention assumes paramount importance in the present stage of international relations."
20,1965,EGY,Recent international events prove that it has become absolutely essential to affirm the principle of non-intervention and to assure absolute respect for it.
20,1965,EGY,"We trust that all Member States will cooperate in this effort, with a view to reaching positive results which would ensure full respect for, and compliance with, the principle of non-intervention."

20,1965,GIN,"In this connexion, the Government of Guinea fully supports the proposal made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, submitted as a Declaration, during the general debate on ""The inadmissibility of intervention in the domestic affairs of States and protection of their independence and sovereignty"" [see A/5977]."
20,1965,GIN,"I shall limit my remarks on the question of Viet-Nam to a reminder of my Government's conviction that no tenable solution can be found to this vexed question until the bombing of North Viet-Nam by the United States interventionist army ceases and all parties to the conflict unreservedly accept a return to the 1954 Geneva Agreements, non-intervention in the internal affairs of Viet-Nam and strict respect for the independence of that martyred country and for the self-determination of its proud and intrepid people, who will have given the finest lessons of courage to all mankind in their long heroic struggle against foreign aggression."
20,1965,SLE,"My Government has always believed in the principles of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States, of respect for territorial integrity, and of self-determination."
20,1965,RUS,"Desiring to contribute to making the twentieth session of the General Assembly justify the hopes placed in it, and to arrive at decisions called for by the serious international situation, the USSR Government proposes that the General Assembly should examine an important and urgent new item entitled ""The inadmissibility of intervention in the domestic affairs of States and the protection of their independence and sovereignty"" [A/5977]."
20,1965,RUS,The adoption by the General Assembly of a special declaration on the inadmissibility of intervention in the domestic affairs of States and the protection of their independence and sovereignty would constitute a new and vigorous step by the United Nations towards ensuring international security.
20,1965,COL,"No restrictions or conditions can be placed upon the right of a group of States, duly associated and bound reciprocally to respect each other's sovereignty — a right which individually they cannot be denied — to keep their distance from a threat to the peace or to disassociate themselves from centres of unrest that threaten international security by preaching and practising violence, subversive infiltration and intervention."
20,1965,COL,"My delegation believes that it is appropriate to stress in this respect the need for a vigorous reaffirmation of the principle of non-intervention, which is the cornerstone of respect for the personality of States and an essential element of peaceful international coexistence."
20,1965,COL,"In the light of elementary political considerations and in view of the legal basis on which the international community must be founded, nothing can justify the intervention of one State in the domestic or external affairs of another: not even the threat of intervention from another source, since the second would be justified a posteriori by the first."
20,1965,PRT,"The war between India and Pakistan was stopped, at least for the time being, and a cease-fire was imposed without any intervention of any international peace-keeping force."
20,1965,UGA,We reject the argument that the United Kingdom Government has no constitutional powers of intervention in the affairs of Southern Rhodesia because that colony has been self-governing since 1923 and because the United Kingdom has no army in the country.
20,1965,GHA,It is unrealistic to suppose that there can be peace in Viet-Nam if foreign intervention continues.
20,1965,AFG,"In this regard, Afghanistan welcomes the item proposed by the delegation of the United Kingdom [A/5964], We welcome, also, the consideration of the item proposed by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (A/5977], which has provided the General Assembly with an opportunity to give full consideration to the essential principle of non-intervention."
20,1965,AFG,"For example, the collective action taken by the Security Council in the India-Pakistan dispute, the courageous intervention of the Secretary-General, and the wisdom demonstrated by the Member States involved in accepting the suggestion of the United Nations, have gratified us, not only because they have led to the prevention of bloodshed, but also because they have strengthened our faith in the effectiveness of the United Nations Organization."
20,1965,TUN,"A policy of intervention, encouraged and sustained by the expansionism of the People's Republic of China, baptized this genuine war of conquest in South-East Asia, with the catchword ""liberation"" — which, I might add, had already been achieved."
20,1965,TUN,"We deeply deplore this situation which, despite the appeals of the Security Council and the intervention of the Secretary-General, deteriorated steadily until just recently, and we have the impression that it is not all over yet."
20,1965,TUN,"We are convinced that it is not too late to remedy this situation and believe that the law of the United Nations must again assert its authority and serve as a basis for the settlement of a dispute which, if it continues, can no longer involve only India and Pakistan; quite the contrary, as the recent developments have shown, the road would be wide open for interference and intervention that would gravely imperil the harmony and stability of South-East Asia."
20,1965,VEN,"The international legal order which twentieth century man has built up patiently and at great sacrifice and which must be the basis of this world Organization is founded on principles and postulates of self-determination of peoples, non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other countries, the sovereign equality of States and respect for human rights, which acknowledge life to be the supreme gift and proclaim respect for the dignity of the human person."
20,1965,VEN,"We cannot Ignore — and I made reference to this In my statement to this Assembly last year [1295th meeting] — the new forms of indirect aggression which run counter to the principle of non-intervention and are characterized by the assistance given by some States, in the form of material resources, money, armaments and propaganda, to armed groups that have infiltrated into other countries to help bring about the downfall of institutional forms of government which were freely adopted."
20,1965,VEN,"In view of the recurrence of this phenomenon, which is obvious to everyone, we reaffirm the need for the countries represented in this world Organization to agree to study with sincerity and urgency the characteristics and methods of this new form of aggression, with the firm intention of concluding a special covenant which will provide means for combating such aggression effectively and adequate sanctions to be applied to Governments found guilty of such acts of intervention and indirect aggression."
20,1965,UKR,"The most dangerous situation exists in South-East Asia, where the armed forces of the United States are being used for direct intervention in the domestic affairs of South Viet-Nam and for aggressive actions against the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam."
20,1965,UKR,"Political and economic pressures, blackmail, economic blockade, and smuggling of armed bandits, military intervention — this is only an incomplete list of the means of interference used by the imperialists."
20,1965,UKR,"Is it not a mockery of the principles of the United Nations when, a day before the opening of the present session of the General Assembly, the House of Representatives of the United States Congress adopts an unprecedented resolution authorizing armed intervention by the United States in any country of Latin America under the pretext of a struggle against communism? How does that conform with the United Nations Charter or even with the charter of the Organization of American States, which contain direct prohibitions on the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or interference in the internal affairs of States? No considerations of a political, economic or other character, no inventions about the communist threat, can justify violation of those provisions of the United Nations Charter."
20,1965,HTI,"I should also like to mention, as an encouraging sign of the future of mankind under the auspices of our Organization, the cease-fire obtained through the intervention of the United Nations and the intelligent endeavours of the Secretary-General, U Thant, in the dispute between two sister nations, India and Pakistan, both Members of the United Nations and both called upon to promote the concept of the peaceful settlement of disputes and the procedures of conciliation and arbitration."
20,1965,SDN,We believe that the disruptive activities that some of the big Powers embark upon within the territories of smaller countries are not less dangerous than armed intervention.
20,1965,MEX,"It concerns the formulation of certain principles relating to friendly relations and cooperation among States, namely, the prohibition of the use of force, the peaceful settlement of disputes, non-intervention, and the sovereign equality of States."
20,1965,MEX,"The prohibition of the use of force, the peaceful settlement of disputes, non-intervention, the legal equality of States and free self-determination of peoples are and always have been guiding principles of Mexico's foreign policy."
20,1965,ECU,"We can note with satisfaction, however, that in the dispute between India and Pakistan United Nations intervention enabled an effective start to be made on the settlement of a conflict of incalculable proportions."
20,1965,ECU,"Although Chapter VII of the Charter provides for the measures to be adopted by the Security Council to restore peace, action by that organ has in many cases been paralysed by various factors, mainly of a political nature, which have prevented its timely intervention."
20,1965,ECU,"Such principles are the very backbone of the Organization, which is clearly based on the prohibition of the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, on the peaceful settlement of international disputes, on the principle of non-intervention and free determination of peoples and on the sovereign equality of all States."
20,1965,ECU,The principle of non-intervention is the cornerstone both of the world Organization and of the inter-American system.
20,1965,ECU,The strength of the principle of non-intervention in Latin American circles is due to the fact that it is rooted in the very origin of the nationhood of the peoples in this part of the continent.
20,1965,ECU,"For this reason, Ecuador must state its formal rejection of any initiative designed to encourage unilateral military intervention, whatever its motive."
20,1965,ECU,"If such an initiative were to become the norm of a new policy of the American States, this would bring about a serious threat to peaceful coexistence among the peoples of the continent and a return to the application of procedures which should be considered superseded, since the subjective evaluation of the international conflicts which arise in States could lead to culpable and indiscriminate intervention in the countries of the hemisphere, through the action of military forces."
20,1965,ECU,"In view of this, in the case of the Dominican Republic — which was heatedly discussed within the United States itself —  the Government of Ecuador was obliged to vote, in the Organization of American States, against the unilateral intervention by that country in the Dominican Republic, while acknowledging that the American nations are bound by contractual instruments to prevent interference by international communism in their respective territories, because' we consider such interference to be an equal threat to the principle of non-intervention."
20,1965,ECU,"I think that we must urgently seek the legal instrument or instruments which, while saving the sacred principle of non-intervention from being shipwrecked once and for all, will provide flexible methods and legal machinery for the immediate elimination of totalitarian subversion from the internal lives of our countries."
20,1965,ECU,"It is therefore not possible to concede the exception claimed by some administering Powers on the grounds that such territories constitute an integral part of their geographical heritage and that, in consequence, their independence cannot be discussed without infringing the principle of non-intervention."
20,1965,BGR,"The general hostility towards this policy of aggression against the people of Viet-Nam and the condemnation of the policy of intervention in the domestic affairs of that country have forced the United States, while it heightens the conflict, to try to drape itself in a flag of peace."
20,1965,BGR,"This has not been the case in Korea, where the United Nations flag is still being used for intervention in the domestic affairs of that country."
20,1965,BGR,A real contribution to the reunification of that country could be made by action to prevent the United States using the United Nations flag to cover up its intervention in that country and by the dissolution of the United Nations Commission for the Reunification and Rehabilitation of Korea.
20,1965,BGR,"The United States intervention in the domestic affairs of the Dominican Republic, imposed and then carried on under the cover of a regional organization, has been just as much a threat to peace."
20,1965,BGR,In the circumstances it is not surprising that the Soviet Union proposal to consider the question of the inadmissibility of intervention in the domestic affairs of States and the protection of their independence and sovereignty [see A/5977] has been favourably received by delegations.
20,1965,BGR,"Is it necessary to remind some Powers and some circles that de facto opposition to progressive ideas or to the formation of Governments that peoples choose for themselves becomes, under the Charter, an international crime when it goes beyond national frontiers? In the circumstances it is certain that the United Nations, guided by the need to protect the independence and sovereignty of States, must find the ways and means for a clear and powerful condemnation of intervention in the domestic affairs of countries, both in the debates and in the decisions of the General Assembly at its twentieth session."
20,1965,BGR,"While we are referring to the remnants of colonialism, it might be useful to draw the attention of delegations to the necessity of trying to put an end to certain situations which have required United Nations mediation or intervention; but — and I am quoting from the introduction to the Annual Report of the Secretary-General:  ""."
20,1965,ROU,"In order to justify their political and, economic interference in the affairs of other States, these forces stop at nothing; they base themselves on ""theories"" to the effect that sovereignty and independence are outmoded concepts, and do not even shrink from armed intervention."
20,1965,ROU,Every people has the sacred right to choose the course of its own political and social development and to defend its freedom against any intervention from outside.
20,1965,ROU,"The military intervention of the United States of America in Viet-Nam constitutes a flagrant violation of the most elementary principles governing international relations, poisons the international atmosphere and gravely endangers the peace in South-East Asia and the world as a whole."
20,1965,CHL,"We are convinced that ideological differences need not be obstacles to coexistence, enduring relations and co-operation with all countries which accept peaceful coexistence, respect the right of peoples to self-determination and abide by the principle of non-intervention."
20,1965,CHL,"It must accept among its members all the countries of the region, whatever their governmental, economic or social systems may be, provided always they respect the basic principles of non-intervention and the protection and support of human rights."
20,1965,CHL,Non-intervention is a fundamental duty of all peoples.
20,1965,ALB,"What is at stake in Viet-Nam is the future of peace and freedom, the right of people to freedom and self-determination against the force and the ruthless intervention of the United States of America."
20,1965,ALB,"The United States is now endeavouring to make use of the United Nations in its war of aggression in Viet-Nam, while in the Dominican Republic the Security Council has in effect given legal sanction to the military intervention of the United States."
20,1965,ALB,"The freedom, independence and sovereignty, the right to self-determination and self-government, the political decisions of every independent people and State must be preserved in all circumstances from every form of intervention, whether open or concealed."
20,1965,ALB,"The great imperialist Powers and certain degenerate chauvinist leaders have not renounced this policy of oppression, political and economic blackmail, gross intervention and dissimulated or blatant intrigue against sovereign peoples and countries."
20,1965,ALB,"This policy is a cover for aggression, blackmail, political and economic pressure and armed intervention."
20,1965,ALB,"But it is possible to face the threats as well as the plots and the gross intervention, even if armed."
20,1965,ALB,"The new Albania, which maintains and is developing friendly relations with a considerable number of countries on the basis of the principles of equality, non-intervention and mutual respect, has acquired, by its just and peaceful policy, the right to speak freely in this Assembly, to express its opinion openly and plainly, even if that does not please the representatives of the United States of America and certain others."
20,1965,MNG,"This open intervention has persisted, in opposition to the just demand of the Dominican people for the restoration and maintenance of constitutional order in their country."
20,1965,LBN,We In the United Nations watch their agony with a sense of frustration that our Organization is unable to assist them in re-establishing peace and the conditions under which they could exercise their right of self-determination and shape their own destiny without outside intervention.
20,1965,BEN,"In America, the periodic agitation in the Caribbean, aggravated by outside intervention, is a source of constant concern."
20,1965,CAN,The parties to a dispute should not expect to enjoy the benefits of United Nations intervention without accepting responsibility to settle their differences and thus facilitate the earliest possible termination of peace-keeping measures.
20,1965,URY,"To sum up, I should like to say that in my country we are tired of seeing the flag of freedom waved while the basest crimes are committed and while the principles of non-intervention and the self-determination of peoples are hypocritically flouted in the name of that freedom."
20,1965,CMR,"We are likewise in full sympathy with the people of Viet-Nam, who have suffered so much and so long not only from war but also and primarily from foreign intervention."
20,1965,CUB,"Examples which illustrate this are to be found in the military intervention in Santo Domingo, in the bombing of towns and villages of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and in statements by the United States President and House of Representatives; asserting the right of the United States to intervene unilaterally in any country of Latin America."
20,1965,CUB,"If international peace and security are today gravely compromised, that is due to the United States Government’s policy of armed intervention in the domestic affairs of other countries."
20,1965,CUB,"The Congo (Leopoldville), which has scarcely been able to savour the fruits of independence, is today a country where intervention and exploitation by a few European Powers covetous of its mineral resources are taking place with the connivance of Yankee imperialism, the largest shareholder in that dirty business."
20,1965,CUB,The most obvious proof of its increasing strength is the fact that the imperialists have been obliged to resort to direct armed intervention in the internal affairs of Latin American States in an attempt to impose their policy.
20,1965,CUB,The Dominican people now know that such intervention can be ended only by the liquidation of imperialism.
20,1965,CUB,"""Those who sow the wind reap the whirlwind, and those who sowed intervention against Cuba, collective severing of relations with Cuba, and the blockade of Cuba are reaping the whirlwinds of interventionism and threats against themselves."
20,1965,KEN,Otherwise what is the purpose of the United Nations if the United States feels that it can interfere in Viet-Nam unilaterally and determine the destiny of that country single-handed on the false assumption that its military might gives it a license to threaten world peace with impunity? In our opinion United States intervention in Viet-Nam is the greatest menace to international peace and security.
20,1965,KEN,"It is not easy to spare from condemnation the imposed constitution and the Treaty of Guarantee under which condemnation the imposed constitution and the Treaty of Guarantee under which the right of intervention in Cypriot affairs is granted to the interested parties, including Britain, Greece, and Turkey."
20,1965,KEN,"In practice, however, the smaller nations continue to suffer from the grossest intervention of big Powers."
20,1965,KEN,Such intervention may amount to armed assistance to the Africans in Southern Rhodesia.
20,1965,PAK,"""It condemns the use of force, and all forms of intimidation, interference and intervention which are aimed at preventing the exercise of this right."
20,1965,CAF,"Thus, with regard to the situation in Viet-Nam, we repeatedly reaffirm the principles in which we believe, namely, non-intervention by foreign Powers and the absolute freedom of all peoples to choose their own destiny."
20,1965,CAF,"Within the international community, the Central African Republic proposes to choose its friends freely with scrupulous respect for the principle of non-intervention, in the profound belief that those relationships, which are bound to become increasingly closer and stronger, do not necessarily constitute a commitment, much less an allegiance."
20,1965,CYP,"We have declared once again that colonialism must be eradicated, that racism must be eliminated, that freedom must become universal, that self-determination must be fully applied, that the sovereignty of all States must be respected, that intervention in the internal affairs of States must be excluded, that conditions of peace must be created."
20,1965,CYP,We cannot tolerate intervention in one case and oppose intervention in another case.
20,1965,CYP,"Intervention in the internal: affairs of a State or forcible intervention, on any pretext, at the expense of any State, in violation of its sovereignty and independence, must."
20,1965,CYP,"be condemned without any hesitation and without any qualification whatsoever, whether such intervention is perpetrated by a big Power or a small one."
20,1965,CYP,"It is encouraging and highly gratifying that additional emphasis is being given this year to this most important subject by the inclusion in the agenda of the present session, at the request of the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union, of the item entitled ""The inadmissibility of intervention in the domestic affairs of States and the protection of their independence and sovereignty"" [see A/5977]."
20,1965,CYP,The principle of non-intervention and the principle of the respect of the sovereignty of States are of a universal character.
20,1965,CYP,There was complete unanimity with regard to the respect of the principles of non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of one State by another.
20,1965,CYP,"Whether it is peace-keeping, whether it is disarmament, whether it is decolonization, whether it is the application of the principles to which we are all committed, whether it is the elimination of discrimination, whether it is respect for the principle of non-intervention, whether it is respect for human rights, whether it is respect for and the application of the principle of self-determination, whether it is the prevention of conflicts, or whether it is the peaceful settlement of disputes, the necessity for the United Nations to be effective is as urgent as ever."
20,1965,NZL,"What is ""domestic jurisdiction""? What is ""coercion""? What is ""intervention""? What is ""aggression""? These are all problems which reveal differences of approach to particular issues."
20,1965,BLR,"Gromyko, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the USSR and Chairman of the USSR delegation, proposed [1335th meeting] the immediate consideration of the question of the ""inadmissibility of intervention in the domestic affairs of States and the protection of their independence and sovereignty"" [A/5977]."
20,1965,BLR,"We all know that, despite the provisions of the United Nations Charter, acts of intervention, including armed intervention, continue to take place in the domestic affairs of States."
20,1965,BLR,The new and noble initiative of the Soviet Union seeks to put an end to such acts of intervention and to prohibit such acts in the future.
20,1965,BLR,"The Byelorussian SSR, which bases its policies on the Leninist principles of friendship and cooperation among peoples, of peace and peaceful coexistence between States having different social, and economic systems, attaches particular importance to the question of prohibiting foreign intervention."
20,1965,BLR,"This is borne out by the facts of the blatant intervention by aggressive forces in the affairs of courageous Cuba, their excesses in the Congo and their violation of the rights of the Dominican Republic."
20,1965,BLR,"A flagrant example of gross armed intervention, fraught with serious consequences for the whole world, is the United States aggression in Viet-Nam."
20,1965,BLR,"The intervention of United States armed forces in South Viet-Nam, and the barbarous bombings of the territory of the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam are acts fundamentally contrary to the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter."
20,1965,BLR,"What the small nations need is to be guaranteed against intervention in their affairs, regardless of whose selfish interests such intervention is intended to serve."
20,1965,BLR,What is required of the United States is that it cease its armed intervention and recognize the right of the Viet-Namese people to choose for themselves their course of development.
20,1965,BLR,"Such bases are a manifestation of the policy of intervention, and whatever the pretext under which they are established, it is time to do away with them."
20,1965,BLR,"We must strengthen the unity of the anti-colonialist, anti-imperialist front on the basis of the struggle for peace, security, justice and progress; we must resolutely oppose all discrimination, wherever and in whatever form it may occur; we must more actively resist attempts at foreign intervention, which brings with it as in the Congo the disruption of progressive forces, chaos and serious new problems."
20,1965,LKA,"It would be my submission that for the achievement of this objective an emergency force, got together in haste, ad hoc, and after the occurrence of an event in some part of the world which calls for the active intervention of the United Nations, will not suffice."
20,1965,THA,"Had it not been for the timely intervention of nations willing to undertake the heavy responsibility for peace and freedom, the people of South Viet-Nam might already have succumbed to the vicious onslaughts from the north."
20,1965,THA,The difference between what existed then and the situation now may be that the seeds of world-wide conflict have been rendered sterile by the opportune intervention.
20,1965,THA,What has been said above will no doubt have a bearing on the commendable proposal for this Organization to issue a declaration on non-intervention.
20,1965,THA,"If nonintervention were to apply to all without exception and were not limited to certain quarters; if that notion would not exempt from its application certain activities known as ""national liberation movements""; and if ultimately non-intervention were to apply from the start and not at a certain stage of development of any given situation when a previous intervention had already taken place, such as in the case of Viet-Nam, then we would gladly concur with the proposal."
20,1965,AUS,"The scale of this outside intervention increased to a point where, late last year, actual regular military units started to be moved into position and some of their members went into South Viet-Nam."
20,1965,FIN,The intervention of the United Nations in this conflict proved to be successful primarily because the Security Council was able to agree on the steps needed to restore peace.
20,1965,FIN,"As important as it is to stop violence, the intervention of the United Nations must not be limited to insulating the political problem in question."
20,1965,GTM,"We regret that local wars are destroying world peace and that communism, using international subversion, which is a new form of intervention, is attacking peaceful and democratic nations,, disrupting their development."
20,1965,SWE,At some stage they must be given the right to decide their own future without foreign intervention and without internal terror.
20,1965,CSK,"This year in particular we have witnessed intensified efforts to stop and reverse the process of reducing international tension; there has been a return to the overt use of force, to aggression and armed intervention against peace-loving peoples."
20,1965,CSK,Our full support is also given to the just struggle of the Korean people for the immediate withdrawal of United States troops from the southern part of the country and for the peaceful unification of their homeland without foreign intervention.
20,1965,CSK,"Another typical example of the contemporary methods of United States foreign policy, aimed at slowing progress and preventing peoples from settling their own national affairs, is the recent military intervention of the United States in the Dominican Republic."
20,1965,CSK,The imperial lists are continuing their flagrant intervention in the internal affairs of the Congolese people.
20,1965,CSK,"In order to ensure the uninterrupted development of peaceful international relations, it is particularly necessary to take steps to end the use or threat of force in relations between States and armed intervention in the internal affairs of other countries."
20,1965,CSK,"I have in mind, first and foremost, the inalienable right of every State and people to freedom and independence and to the & fence of their sovereignty, and the duty of States to be guided by the principles of mutual respect and non-intervention in the internal affairs of another State."
20,1965,CSK,"For these reasons the Czechoslovak delegation considers the draft declaration on the inadmissibility of intervention in the domestic affairs of States and the protection of their independence and sovereignty, submitted by the USSR delegation to the present session of the General Assembly [1336th meeting], to be extremely topical and urgent."
20,1965,COG,Such cases of military intervention as the United States aggression in Viet- Nam or the acts of aggression committed at Stanleyville and in the Dominican Republic are part of this policy of world domination and subjugation of the small countries.
20,1965,COG,"We strongly condemn this aggression committed in flagrant violation of the 1954 Geneva Agreements and no arguments, either alleged communist aggression or any other reason, advanced by the United States, can justify that country's intervention in the affairs of the Viet-Namese people."
20,1965,COG,It is in Viet-Nam that this world-wide intervention has been the most prolonged and on the most massive scale.
20,1965,KHM,"If the United Nations remains indifferent to the United States military intervention in Viet-Nam, it is certain that other great Powers will see in that a justification for similar enterprises against other countries."
20,1965,KHM,The Cambodian delegation therefore hopes that there are Powers or countries in the Assembly which will ensure that the question of United States intervention in South-East Asia and of the right of the peoples of Indo-China to settle their problems without interference from any Power or organization is placed on the agenda.
20,1965,KHM,"The West would certainly not tolerate it and, similarly, the recent events in Los Angeles, had they occurred in a ""coloured"" country, would certainly have led to immediate intervention by the Marines."
20,1965,ARG,People desiring to carry out their own revolution must therefore either refrain from doing so in order to prevent intervention by foreign forces or carry it out in a manner acceptable to foreigners.
20,1965,ARG,"If one is tantamount to aggressive intervention that unleashes an international war, the other is an illegal intervention that provokes national rebellion."
20,1965,ARG,"Any unilateral intervention, no matter how well-intentioned, would run counter to the principles and guarantees essential to international security."
20,1965,ZMB,"We view with dismay statements made by the British Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, during his recent visit to West Africa, that the Africans of Southern Rhodesia are not ripe for self-rule and that, in the event of a unilateral declaration of independence, the United Kingdom would never undertake military intervention as a counter-measure because Rhodesia is too strong militarily."
20,1965,SLV,"Respecting as it does the equality and sovereignly of all States, without which there can be no International coexistence, El Salvador wishes to reiterate here, as it has done on numerous occasions, its dedication to the principle of non-intervention and to the right of peoples to self-determination without foreign interference."
20,1965,POL,In the Dominican Republic an armed intervention by the powerful neighbour of that small country is but another symptom of evil persisting in international relations.
20,1965,POL,"We welcome therefore the timely proposal of the Soviet Union [A/5977] to the effect that the General Assembly, in a declaration on the inadmissibility of intervention in the domestic affairs of States and on the protection of their independence and sovereignty, should solemnly and categorically reaffirm one of the fundamental legal principles in relations among States."
20,1965,POL,We cannot forget that such territories were used for imperialist intervention in the Congo and that such territories are being used in the bombing of Viet-Nam hour after hour while we are sitting here and deliberating about peace.
20,1965,TGO,"The United Kingdom cannot evade its heavy responsibility before world public opinion by sheltering behind a pretext of non-intervention in the internal affairs of a territory which, legally, is still a Crown Colony."
20,1965,PHL,"There is hardly any doubt that direct Communist Chinese intervention would provoke counter-intervention by other Powers, thereby setting off a world conflagration which, in this age of thermonuclear weapons, could lead us down the road to irreversible catastrophe."
20,1965,MWI,No nation which encourages warlike intervention in the affairs of other countries or which is not prepared to settle its differences with others otherwise than by the use of armed force has any right to claim membership of that Organization.
20,1965,PER,"The most dangerous form of tension, however, is that derived from the direct or indirect intervention of some great Power to overthrow régimes in other countries which it considers to be unfriendly and to have them replaced by régimes which are not only friendly but which fellow its political system."
20,1965,PER,"In other words, the danger today — as at other times — lies in the struggle for spheres of influence, with violation of respect for sovereignty and the overt or covert exercise of intervention."
20,1965,PER,the principle of non-intervention.
20,1965,MLI,The continuation of the foreign military intervention in Viet-Nam is an aberration.
20,1965,MLI,"In our opinion, the States Members of the United Nations must work not towards direct intervention by the Organization in settling the conflict, but towards vigorous and continued action for the strict application of the 1954 Geneva Agreements, as the first stage in the settlement of this conflict."
20,1965,MLI,It supports the USSR Government's draft declaration on the inadmissibility of intervention in the domestic affairs of States and on the protection of their independence and sovereignty [see A/5977].
20,1965,FRA,"For years now, and in the first place through the voice of General de Gaulle, France has spoken out clearly on the settlement which it regards as the only possible one and which, in its view, mast be based on the independence and neutrality of Viet-Nam and on non-intervention in its domestic affairs, as those principles were defined in the 1954 Geneva agreements."
20,1965,FRA,"Another, clearly, is the growing and spectacular intervention of China in the world's affairs, a China which is now a nuclear Power, and the fact that its action cannot be exercised within the framework available to all the other Powers."
20,1965,FRA,"We also believe that such a policy must be subordinated to the express condition that we refrain from linking aid, whatever form it may take, to any political condition whatsoever and that we refrain from any intervention, in that connexion, in the affairs of our partners."
20,1965,ZAF,"I believe that I cannot more effectively stress my reference to the dangers of communist intervention in the affairs of other nations, whether on the continents of America, of Europe, of Asia or of Africa, than to refer to a statement by Mr."
20,1965,ZAF,"But what is more, nations cannot against their will be forced by foreign intervention to share a single statehood."
28,1973,SGP,"They have ranged from anti-colonial wars and wars of intervention to insurgencies, civil wars, wars of liberation and disputes between third-world countries."
28,1973,IRQ,"In Asia, in spite of the world's glad expectations aroused by the reaching of a peace agreement to end the singularly inhuman war waged by the United States of America against the struggling people of Viet-Nam, we find that the agreement, which was regarded as the beginning of the end of American military intervention in South-East Asia, did not in fact stop the bloodshed in that area, but rather became itself the target of continuous manoeuvres attempting to impose the Saigon regime on the people of South Viet-Nam."
28,1973,YUG,"Moreover, there is no hesitation even in resorting to open armed intervention for the purpose of obstructing the liberation of peoples from imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism and all other forms of domination and exploitation."
28,1973,YUG,The only road leading to the consolidation of peace in this area lies in strict implementation of the agreements concluded and in the total cessation of any external intervention in all countries of Indo-China.
28,1973,YUG,It is likewise necessary to put an end to the continued external intervention in Cambodia.
28,1973,YUG,"It is both absurd and unacceptable to have Lon Nol's regime, which came into power through foreign intervention, representing Cambodia in the United Nations."
28,1973,GIN,"Throughout his intervention during the present session of the General Assembly the ""worthy representative"", ""the accredited spokesman of Portugal"", Mr."
28,1973,GIN,I should not wish to end this intervention without saying a few words about the drought that has recently afflicted six States in the Sudano-Sahelian region and which has ravaged in an unprecedented way the population and livestock of that region.
28,1973,COG,"It is also urgent to have redefinition of relations among States to put an end to external intervention, which is ever-more open and arrogant, in the internal affairs of young nations."
28,1973,COG,We condemn most vigorously — and representatives no doubt have sensed this throughout our statement — any intervention in the internal affairs of other countries.
28,1973,KHM,"But to manoeuvre to impose such a government on the Khmer people constitutes inadmissible intervention in the internal affairs of that people, and we vigorously protest against such an act."
28,1973,ESP,"A plurality of options must be allowed to exist; otherwise, there might well arise large-scale intervention and conflict, whose outcome would be a general world confrontation, after which no one would remain to tell the tale."
28,1973,CHL,"We could prove, too, the extremely dangerous level of foreign intervention in our affairs, as well as the way in which bands of actual criminals were preparing to administer the final blow to all those who were not already unconditionally enslaved."
28,1973,CHL,We maintain our traditional respect for and hospitality to foreigners; but we shall be very careful to avoid a repetition of the reprehensible acts of foreign intervention that have caused the country so much suffering.
28,1973,CHL,"Another guiding principle of our foreign policy will be, as always, the principle of non-intervention in the domestic or external affairs of other States."
28,1973,CHL,Now I wonder — do we need any more barefaced proof of intervention in Chilean political life? Can there be any doubt regarding the origin of the political directives and the support for illegality? 171.
28,1973,CHL,It can only be explained as a futile and desperate attempt to cover up the seriousness of their intervention in the internal affairs of my country.
28,1973,CHL,"On the basis of the fact that we can maintain normal relations only with those countries which respect us, we also severed relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea — after we were able to prove that there had been intervention in our internal affairs and an involvement of that country's diplomatic representatives in the training of guerrillas."
28,1973,CHL,They will find no opposition on our part — so long as our future relations can be based upon mutual respect and non-intervention in internal and external affairs.
28,1973,PRT,"In one zone — the economically developed area — the principles of non-intervention, respect for national sovereignty, territorial integrity and peaceful coexistence would be held valid."
28,1973,PRT,"In the other zone, that of the less-developed and poor nations, intervention in the internal affairs of other States would be allowed, subversion and terrorism legalized, and violence held not only justifiable, but worthy of praise and of outside support."
28,1973,PRT,Attempts are made to justify the intervention by African States and by the OAU in Portuguese Territories in the name of African solidarity.
28,1973,MMR,"Speaking of developments nearer home, in the form of initiatives coming from within the regions which have been prompted by these considerations, we notice the movements under way to secure the recognition of and respect for the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace, and of the South-East Asian region as a whole as a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality, free from any form or manner of intervention by the outside Powers."
28,1973,MMR,It acknowledges the inadmissibility of outside intervention in the internal affairs of any of these Indo-Chinese States.
28,1973,MMR,"What is significant is that they are acknowledged and reaffirmed after years of bitter conflict in Indo-China, which has seen massive intervention by outside Powers and which has brought untold suffering to the valiant Indo-Chinese peoples and immeasurable damage and destruction to their countries."
28,1973,NGA,"It is to the credit of this Organization that, even when conflicts do occur between nations in recent times, peaceful intervention by the United Nations has succeeded in arresting them."
28,1973,MRT,"Concerning Indo-China, the signing on 27 January 1973 in Paris of agreements on Viet-Nam, the cessation of the American bombardment of Cambodia and the Vientiane agreement' open up new prospects for the people of Indo-China, who have so long been scourged by war and foreign intervention."
28,1973,MRT,And it cannot be established so long as foreign intervention is manifested in support of all kinds for the Lon Nol regime and so long as the Saigon administration and those who support it do not really commit themselves to respecting the Paris agreements.
28,1973,MRT,The Korean people cannot bring about its independence and peaceful reunification save through exercise of its right to self-determination in the absence of any foreign intervention.
28,1973,NIC,"After greeting you, Sir, most respectfully, I am happy to begin my intervention, as head of the Nicaraguan delegation, with an expression of congratulations to Mr."
28,1973,ALB,"Under the fallacious pretext that it is appropriate to take measures to ward off the threat of a nuclear war and prevent all forms of military confrontation, the two super-Powers are actually trying, through this agreement, to make sacrosanct at the present time in legal terms their right to intervene jointly at a time and a place they consider appropriate and to define the terms of this intervention."
28,1973,ALB,We should bar the way to any imperialist intervention in this part of the world and restore all the sovereign rights of the Palestine people.
28,1973,ALB,"In fact, it is pursuing its military commitment and its intervention in the domestic affairs of the people of Viet-Nam and the other peoples of Indo-China, and placing serious obstacles in the path of the establishment of true peace in Viet-Nam."
28,1973,ALB,"The achievement of the legitimate aspirations of the Korean people and the interests of peace and stability in the Far East demand that as soon as possible a remedy should be found for this intolerable situation, and that the United States should withdraw its troops and its bases from South Korea and cease all military engagements in that country, that the illegal United Nations Commission for the Reunification and Rehabilitation of Korea should be dissolved immediately, and that any intervention by the United Nations in the domestic affairs of the Korean people should cease."
28,1973,ALB,"The Korean people has the supreme and sovereign right to decide for itself all the questions that concern it without intervention from outside, and that is something that no one has the right to deny to that people."
28,1973,HTI,"However, notwithstanding the numerous resolutions adopted by the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council, UNCTAD and other agencies of the United Nations family, the peoples of the third world continue to have their aspirations to progress frustrated by the growing disparities between the prices for goods and services from the industrialized countries and the prices of natural resources and exports; by tariff barriers and other restrictive trade practices; by the incompatibility of private investment with the goals and priorities of national development plans; by the dangerous intervention of multinational corporations in the political affairs of host countries."
28,1973,ARE,We have pledged ourselves to act together to defend our independence and resist any foreign intervention in our affairs from whatever source.
28,1973,ROU,"President, to the Secretary- General of the United Nations and to the heads of State of many countries of the world calling for their intervention as quickly as possible with the authorities in Chile so that the lives of Luis Corvalan and the other Chilean fighters for progress and democracy may be saved."
28,1973,ROU,"The Romanian Government is of the opinion that everything should be done to put an end to foreign intervention in Viet-Nam and all over Indo-China, so that the Viet-Namese, Laotian and Cambodian peoples, which experienced great hardships because of the war, may devote all their power to reconstruction and to their independent economic and social development."
28,1973,GHA,"The potential for a violent upheaval in southern Africa is undeniable although the strength of the regime suggests that any struggle would be a long and bloody one, if there were no international intervention or mediation."
28,1973,NOR,"In principle the Charter prohibits intervention, in matters within the domestic jurisdiction of any Member State."
28,1973,NOR,I shall not in my intervention today go closely into the substance of these problems.
28,1973,NLD,We call on our partners in the present European dialogue to see these remarks not as an intervention in their internal affairs but as a reflection of the firm conviction that the cause of detente will be promoted by respect for human freedoms in all parts of Europe.
28,1973,COD,"Thus any new intervention on the part of Portugal in Guinea-Bissau will have to be considered as aggression, pure and simple, against an independent State."
28,1973,DZA,"The sovereign rights of that Government must be restored to it in the United Nations, where its seat is unlawfully occupied by the representatives of a regime which owes its survival only to foreign intervention, which merely underlines its usurping character."
28,1973,BDI,"The antagonisms of the super-Powers encourage wars and localized crises in certain parts of the world, thus leading to intervention in the internal affairs of other States."
28,1973,BDI,"In Cambodia the restoration of peace requires, as one of its pre-conditions, the immediate withdrawal of all aggressive and occupying troops, the end of foreign intervention and strict respect for the right of the Cambodian people to self-determination."
28,1973,BDI,Such an attitude constitutes intervention in the internal affairs of a nation.
28,1973,BHR,"Also, we believe that the Gulf area should also remain free from big-Power rivalries and foreign intervention."
28,1973,CHN,Neither has anyone made a similar warning in connexion with the current United States intervention in Cambodia.
28,1973,MDG,"Hence we hold it to be indispensable, first, that there be complete and genuine withdrawal of all forces of foreign intervention, whether in Indo-China, in Korea or in Cambodia; that the task of determining the conditions for participation in national and international political life be left to the peoples of those areas themselves, according to their own standards and not according to models imposed from outside; that the desire of those peoples to live in peace in accord with their own genius be recognized, so that they may live in a coherent society, not a society artificially held together or divided by any insincere allegiance to the sullied values of a foreign civilization; that an end be put to the chauvinism that has been elevated by some to a political principle, international in application but completely untenable because it runs contrary to the sovereignty of peoples."
28,1973,COL,We are defenders of this doctrine in so far as we believe in universality for international relations and the application of the principles of the self-determination of peoples and of non-intervention.
28,1973,SWE,Particularly serious are those cases in which brutal military intervention in favour of privileged groups is directed against Governments which strive to bring about a more equitable society.
28,1973,GRC,"On the question of bringing peace to Indo-China, I shall confine myself to expressing the fervent hope that the agreements and the communiques ensuring peace will be scrupulously applied by all the parties in order to ensure that the so-sorely-tried peoples of that region of the world can live in peace and in respect for human dignity, and that the political will of those peoples will be freely expressed without any foreign intervention."
28,1973,LKA,"The only effective weapon, short of armed intervention —  which is beyond contemplation — is sanctions if they are scrupulously enforced."
28,1973,CSK,"The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic has supported that proposal from the very beginning and is convinced that the charter can become a key document that will ensure progressive principles governing international economic relations and thereby serve as a dynamic instrument for developing those relations on a basis of equality, mutual advantage and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States."
28,1973,PHL,"This Declaration expresses their desire to see peace and stability prevail in Southeast Asia and indeed in the whole Asian region, through the observance of the principle of non-intervention in their domestic affairs."
28,1973,PHL,"But however plausible the reasons may be, intervention in the internal affairs of a State is inadmissible."
28,1973,PRY,"Let us hope that the solution of international conflicts will always be based on respect for the free and sovereign existence of nations, the self-determination of peoples, the impossibility of waging war for military, economic or ideological conquest and on the elementary principle of coexistence and non-intervention in the internal affairs of sovereign States."
28,1973,PRY,"Development is not an exclusive commitment of each nation; it is a responsibility for all nations and requires co-operation within the measure of the possibilities of each, with complete respect for the principle of non-intervention."
28,1973,PRY,"Paraguay wishes the light to shine at every dawn for every man in every region, -with no privileged States and no countries cast into oblivion, with no foreign intervention, exploitation, economic dependence or ideological domination."
28,1973,IND,We earnestly hope that peace and harmony will be restored soon so that the people of Chile can resume their work of national reconstruction and reconciliation without any outside intervention and without further violence.
28,1973,MLI,We want to reaffirm again that the intervention of the United Nations in Korea is a flagrant contradiction of the spirit of the Charter.
28,1973,MAR,"The policy of coexistence and non-alignment — the only possible policy for all those for whom the confrontation of the two blocs ran the risk of affecting their sovereignty, compromising their independence or affecting their territorial integrity — was not only a defensive policy involving the preservation of their own interests, but a policy of intervention on the world scene every time that the great Powers were unable to emerge from a crisis save through a move that might lead them towards war."
28,1973,PER,"However, the security and peace yearned for by two thirds of mankind — that is, the countries of the third world — is not included in the blueprint for detente, for aggression and intervention are still sources of permanent danger that thwart the liberation of peoples struggling for their freedom."
08,1953,GTM,"There have even been shameless calls for intervention, which has been most categorically condemned on the American continent."
08,1953,GTM,"However, it categorically rejects any intervention of a colonial type, and the claim that foreign capital should enjoy privileges which the law does not confer on nationals."
08,1953,ISR,"In particular, it is worth reflecting whether there might not be a valid distinction between a discussion of such problems, a discussion which might have an independent utility of its own, and intervention such as would be involved by the United Nations taking institutional action in areas to which the concept of national sovereignty properly applied."
08,1953,ISR,"There is, I suggest, nothing illogical in a middle position, namely, that it might be useful to discuss a problem even where the right of intervention was precluded by the terms of the Charter."
08,1953,GBR,"Another vital role of this body is to mediate, and indeed to intervene, in disputes threatening peace, in the hope that such intervention will prevent those disputes from developing into hostilities."
08,1953,RUS,"That such is the case has become very much apparent in the past few years, when its name has been used to cloak foreign intervention in Korea in an attempt to legalize the bloody war which was inflicted on the Korean people more than three years."
08,1953,RUS,"The handful of countries which declared Korea an aggressor after attacking it, or rather, which supported the original attack made by Syngman Rhee and then embarked on an operation of intervention, have the power under the North Atlantic Treaty to proclaim any country an aggressor."
08,1953,RUS,"In face of this and the other unchallengeable evidence, how is it possible to go on calmly spreading the false and disproved story that it was North Korea which committed aggression, and to sing the praises of this disgraceful passage in the history of the United Nations, when the Organization was used as the tool for a policy of aggression and a cloak for foreign intervention in Korea? 42."
08,1953,CHN,"Nevertheless, I feel compelled at the beginning of my intervention in this general debate to refer once more to Munich."
08,1953,CZE,The armistice in Korea is the outcome of the collapse of the unjust war of intervention and of the great victory of the Korean and Chinese peoples and of peace- loving forces throughout the world.
08,1953,CZE,"The essential conditions for the practical realization of such co-operation are observance of the principle of equality among interested parties, consistent adherence to the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States, the development of trade on the basis of mutual advantage, and the provision of assistance to the under-developed countries without political conditions which could endanger their independence."
08,1953,CZE,"Accordingly the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic, whose people feel deep sympathy for the heroic Korean people in their hour of need, has decided to assist in the rehabilitation of their country, the victim of a war of intervention."
08,1953,SWE,In my intervention I have aimed at illustrating concretely the significance of the idea of revision.
08,1953,MEX,"That doctrine violates the principle of non-intervention, which has received full recognition within the community of American States and is enshrined among the principles of the United Nations."
08,1953,ZAF,"This evidence comes from the most responsible sources, both inside and outside the Organization, and it would be well to heed the warnings of those who realize that, if the United Nations is to survive as an instrument of peace, this dangerous course of intervention in the domestic affairs of States will have to cease."
08,1953,IND,It is disregard of the Charter and of treaty obligations and the intervention against and violation of the sovereignty of a territory.
08,1953,IND,That brings me to the end of the observations which I desired to make in my intervention in this general debate.
08,1953,CRI,"So long as a final peace has not been concluded in Korea, so long as the war in Indo-China is kept alive through the overt intervention of the communist nations, so long as the problems of Germany and Austria remain unsolved, there is, as Mr."
08,1953,ARG,"The trend noticeable in United Nations practice towards an extension of the powers of some of its principal organs, which may lead to a violation of the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of States, also warrants our most careful attention, whether we are considering the revision of the Charter or studying the true meaning of its text as it stands."
08,1953,ISL,"We have other identical cases, where one of the parties concerned objects to a United Nations intervention and openly ignores any recommendation by the United Nations."
08,1953,ISL,"The representative of the Union of South Africa has always warned the Assembly that its intervention is unconstitutional and its resolutions, therefore, null and void."
08,1953,BLR,"well known, the Security Council has been used to cloak foreign intervention with a mantle of legality and to falsify history."
08,1953,BLR,"Molotov, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the USSR, made the following statement: “Our foreign policy has no aggressive aims and for its part does not admit of intervention in the affairs of other States."
08,1953,POL,"This truth is obvious in spite of all the attempts which have been made, and are still being made by certain delegations from this rostrum, to camouflage United States intervention in Korea as a peaceful action of the United Nations."
34,1979,SDN,"Africa, which for ages has fallen prey to exploitation, enslavement, poverty, suppression and all forms of segregation and foreign intervention, is still suffering from all these evils."
34,1979,SDN,My Government's position with regard to the Korean question has always been based on our commitment to the principle of the resolution of disputes through dialogue and negotiation and the rejection of the use of force and foreign intervention.
34,1979,VNM,"The people of Afghanistan have foiled all attempts at foreign intervention and subversion, thereby consolidating the gains of the April 1978 Revolution."
34,1979,VNM,"What should be denounced is the Chinese intervention in Kampuchea, the Chinese responsibility for the genocide committed by the Pol Pot- Ieng Sary clique against 3 million inhabitants of Kampuchea."
34,1979,YUG,This is possible only if intervention and the use of force are brought to an end; if foreign occupation is ended and foreign troops withdrawn; if the independence and sovereignty of the peoples are respected; and if the peoples involved are accorded the exclusive right to choose their own system of government and way of life without outside interference.
34,1979,YUG,"It would be very dangerous if we were to endorse the thesis of good or bad, justified or unjustified, foreign military intervention."
34,1979,MEX,"Hydrocarbon prices cannot be considered a matter for bargaining and for a testing of strength between producers and consumers, particularly when their respective positions are made more extreme by the intervention of other, generally transnational structures, many of which no longer recognize any home country and consequently acknowledge neither social obligations nor political solidarity."
34,1979,MEX,"We are irrevocably pledged to the principles of self-determination, non-intervention, the peaceful solution of controversies, the economic rights and duties of nations, and solidarity, which are the guidelines of our international conduct."
34,1979,MEX,"We propose a formula of teamwork, aimed not at pretence or at intervention, but at harmonious participation that will integrate and amplify isolated efforts."
34,1979,BTN,"It is our firm belief and conviction that intervention in the internal affairs of States cannot be justified under any circumstances whatsoever, as it goes counter to the sovereign inalienable right of every State to determine its own social, economic and political system, and to manage its own affairs."
34,1979,BEN,"Of course, it must be recognized that the intervention of the various Arab funds, OPEC assistance and financial aid from the Afro-Arab bank organizations such as the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa provide a growing supply of capital and give us the benefit of a not inconsiderable portion of the oil earnings of the producers of the precious black gold."
34,1979,BEN,"And while we welcome the signing at Vienna on 18 June 1979 of the Treaty between the United States and the USSR on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, concluded as a result of the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT] in which we see the beginning of a world of fraternity and friendship among peoples, which we ardently desire, it must be recognized that any armed conflict anywhere in the world and any imperialist intervention, regardless of where it may occur in the world, undermines and jeopardizes the benefits ensuing from the difficult negotiations which led to the second round of SALT."
34,1979,BEN,"Thus, it has elaborated a programme in which the full panoply of the means of aggression, intervention and subversion are refined and enhanced daily by the addition of new instruments of death and terror."
34,1979,BEN,"This is an ignoble, hypocritical and repugnant means of armed intervention, of which my country was cruelly made the victim on 16 January 1977."
34,1979,BEN,"Scarcely a few weeks ago, there was a wide-scale military intervention organized by a certain European Power in an African country."
34,1979,BEN,"And, as our great comrade-in-arms, President Mathieu Kerekou, said at the Conference: ""The mobilization of international opinion against mercenaries, intervention and imperialist aggression is the only way to ensure that a latter-day gunboat policy will not be institutionalized and enforced in an atmosphere of general and unpardonable indifference."
34,1979,MDV,"However, my delegation views it with serious concern, for we believe in absolute freedom for the people of any country to decide and resolve their own political issues without any foreign military intervention."
34,1979,MDV,"Resort to military intervention by one country in the affairs of another inevitably increases international tension, endangers the security and the independence of the peoples of the region, and carries with it the added grave danger of impairing international peace and security."
34,1979,MDV,We cannot condone the imposition of foreign will on any sovereign State by military intervention.
34,1979,MDV,And we must not allow such situations of the violation of the principles of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States to become precedents in this great Organization.
34,1979,ESP,"Both bilaterally and at the level of international organizations, our action with African peoples is based on the following guidelines: first, and above all, resolute support for the United Nations in the struggle against colonialism, apartheid, and racial discrimination; secondly, strict observance of the principle of non-intervention at a time when we are witnesses to a growing participation of forces outside the continent in affairs which only Africans are competent to settle; and, finally, a policy of technical assistance and of economic, financial and cultural co-operation which, seeking mutual benefits, will always respect the uniqueness and the personality of countries which need methods and techniques for the development of their peoples and to reaffirm and safeguard their values, their traditions and their own identity."
34,1979,ESP,"My Government considers that these situations gravely affect the fundamental rights of every human being and of peoples, and that a solution must be found on the basis of the principles of territorial integrity, sovereignty, political independence and non-intervention, which it is our duty to respect."
34,1979,NGA,Africa will no longer tolerate intervention and destabilization exercises in the continent.
34,1979,NGA,"Just as the stalemate in the intervening years, exacerbated by the tragic events of 1974, has remained a matter of grave concern to Nigeria, so also was the failure to build upon the ten-point agreement reached after the Secretary-General's personal intervention last May."
34,1979,PHL,The first was the armed intervention in Kampuchea.
34,1979,PHL,"Profoundly disturbed by this break-down of peace in South-East Asia, ASEAN immediately issued a joint statement in Bangkok expressing its serious concern at the armed intervention in the internal affairs of another country and affirming the right of the people of Kampuchea to determine for themselves the form of government which they desired."
34,1979,TTO,"In this regard, and as an extension of the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States and non-intervention in the domestic affairs of States, Members of this Organization should take particular care to ensure that their territories are not used as bases for subversion of the legal Governments of other Member States."
34,1979,LBY,Then the intervention of the United States of America would be acceptable and its interference would help peace.
34,1979,AUT,The world should not and must not sit by passively while this small and long-suffering country continues to be the victim of constant military intervention.
34,1979,ECU,"The international policy of the country will be based on the principles of non-intervention, self-determination, the legal equality of States, the defence of human rights, respect for ideological pluralism, the opening of relations with all countries, the repudiation of all forms of aggression and intervention and the use of force, the rejection of colonialism and neo-colonialism and the peaceful settlement of disputes."
34,1979,ALB,"The Chinese aggression against the Vietnamese people and all the recent events in Indo-China took place against the background of the fierce rivalry of the imperialist super-Powers—the United States, the Soviet Union and China—which, in order to attain their hegemonic and expansionist aims in that area, employed both the methods of direct intervention and the well-known imperialist practice of inciting Indo- Chinese against Indo-Chinese."
34,1979,ALB,"The Balkan peoples have cause to remember the misfortunes caused them by the intervention of the imperialist Powers in the past, and they have sufficient experience to judge what actions they must take to prevent others from turning the Balkans into a powder keg."
34,1979,ETH,"In this connexion, the Government and people of socialist Ethiopia warmly congratulate the Latin American and Caribbean countries on the high sense of responsibility, determination and firmness they have so courageously demonstrated in opposing all forms of intervention, particularly military intervention in Nicaragua."
34,1979,CHL,"Those principles, which are the basis of our Organization whose validity has been confirmed by experience itself and which doubtless are unanimously felt by ourselves and firmly supported by my Government, are the following: the sovereign equality of all States; the self-determination of peoples and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States; respect for the territorial integrity and political independence of every State; the prohibition and condemnation of the threat or the use of force; the peaceful settlement of ail disputes and compliance in good faith with obligations entered into; and to crown all this, so that we may approach the everlasting peace of Kant, the political will to make a reality of international co-operation."
34,1979,CHL,We therefore reject any armed intervention in their continent and proclaim the inalienable right of its peoples to be the architects of their own destinies.
34,1979,DZA,"Is it not in fact the logic of confrontation which continues to predominate? Growing protectionism with regard to the products of the South and the manipulation of gold, of reserve currencies and of the monetary system generally speaking in order to serve the sole interests of the wealthy countries, not to mention the devising of doctrines of military intervention towards certain countries of the South, can hardly be said to reflect a spirit of co-operation."
34,1979,DZA,"Is it not in fact the logic of confrontation which continues to predominate? Growing protectionism with regard to the products of the South and the manipulation of gold, of reserve currencies and of the monetary system generally speaking in order to serve the sole interests of the wealthy countries, not to mention the devising of doctrines of military intervention towards certain countries of the South, can hardly be said to reflect a spirit of co-operation."
34,1979,COD,"Respect for the principles of non-interference in the internal and external affairs of States and of the peaceful settlement of disputes determines our attitude of non-recourse to force, to military intervention or to armed invasion, and non-destabilization of Governments on any pretext whatsoever."
34,1979,PRY,"We are absolutely true to the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States, and we strictly respect the self-determination of peoples."
34,1979,CPV,"In Cyprus, it is high time that the talks between the two communities should, without outside intervention and as soon as possible, decide on specific action to take to meet the profound aspirations for peace and justice of the Cypriot people, and to achieve unity and territorial integrity in the country, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council."
34,1979,CAN,The timely intervention of United Nations peacekeeping forces has so often brought quiet to a troubled area.
34,1979,SOM,"This is certainly the case in the Horn of Africa, where colonial struggles have been intensified and internationalized through foreign intervention."
34,1979,SOM,"My Government, along with many other African Governments, is deeply concerned over the precedents for foreign intervention in African affairs that have recently been set."
34,1979,SOM,We also deplore intervention by one African State in the affairs of another because of opposition to the policies of its Government.
34,1979,SOM,Where the pre-eminent right to self-determination is not involved such intervention can only damage the structure of African peace and security built on the principles of the OAU.
34,1979,BHR,"It is noted also that the super-Powers have turned to the kindling of conflicts and clashes among the States of the third world, as we can see today in Africa and Asia, instead of to direct intervention, as was their practice in the past."
34,1979,BHR,"We therefore call upon all the States of the world, Members of this Organization, to abide by the principles of the Charter, particularly the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States."
34,1979,BHR,"Therefore, we have called for the establishment of mutual co-operation among the States of the Gulf in the political, economic, cultural and technical fields, on a basis of mutual respect, equality, integrity and non-intervention in domestic affairs, in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter."
34,1979,JPN,"I am of the opinion that the only way to accomplish this is for all foreign forces to withdraw from Kampuchean territory so that the Kampuchean people may determine their own political future, free from any foreign intervention."
34,1979,VEN,"Time and again we have witnessed an almost reflex reaction, namely, invoking the principle of non-intervention by way of exorcism to silence any mention of the principles of the Charter."
34,1979,VEN,"I would not wish to leave the slightest doubt as to the paramount importance of the principle of non-intervention, which Venezuela recognizes, since it is the essential basis for the civilized coexistence of States and the defence of the weak when confronted with the whims of the powerful."
34,1979,NIC,"For 34 years, intervention spoke in this hall through the voice of Somoza and his followers."
34,1979,NIC,"In 1945 it was Somoza and his National Guard, both of them the results of intervention, who made themselves members of the United Nations."
34,1979,NIC,"The triumph of the Popular Sandinist Revolution in Nicaragua also brought about the defeat of unjust positions, attitudes of surrender, a policy of intervention, crime, torture, theft, genocide, and the exploitation represented by the Somoza dictatorship and defended by his accomplices."
34,1979,NIC,"In our country the people, united and led by the Sandinist Front for National Liberation, defeated in an unequal battle the occupation troops which North American intervention had left behind after assassinating Sandino."
34,1979,NIC,"At the Sixth Conference of non-aligned countries, we stated our repugnance with regard to the genocidal Pol Pot clique, which, like Somoza, was the product of foreign intervention and, as such, was in its turn made use of as a spearhead for aggression against the heroic people of Viet Nam."
34,1979,UKR,"Today as never before, durable peace and security depend on the total cessation of the policy of violence and intervention in the internal affairs of States, a policy which is pursued internationally by certain states."
34,1979,IDN,"In particular, it is essential to accord recognition to the principles of respect for the independence of all the States in the region and the sovereign right of those States to define their national policies free from foreign interference and intervention."
34,1979,IDN,"The countries of the region should be given a chance to seek a solution towards meaningful and real peaceful coexistence, regardless of their respective economic, social and political systems, At the same time, the countries of the region should refrain from policies or actions which would give a pretext for or justify interference or intervention by outside Powers."
34,1979,TUN,The numerous conflicts among African nations offer favourable ground for external intervention.
34,1979,MYS,"One of the cardinal principles of the United Nations has been violated by the armed intervention of outside forces against Kampuchea, threatening the peace, stability and security of South-East Asia as a whole."
34,1979,MYS,"The subsequent development after the military intervention showed clearly how the area of conflict could easily widen, threatening to engulf the entire region in a testing-ground of big-Power rivalry."
34,1979,MYS,"The people of Kampuchea must be given the right to decide their own future and destiny, free from outside interference or intervention."
34,1979,AFG,"The acts of provocation and intervention against the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, whose people have already made enormous sacrifices during their heroic anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist struggle, causes us concern."
34,1979,AFG,"While supporting more constructive, serious and effective negotiations between the representatives of both Cypriot communities on an equal footing and without foreign intervention, we believe conditions of normality and peace could better be provided by the withdrawal of all foreign military forces and by ending the foreign military presence in Cyprus."
34,1979,GIN,"But in the opinion of our delegation, what is more dangerous than a foreign intervention is the fact that a Government, by its reactionary, antinational, anti-popular policy could raise the masses against itself, and irretrievably lose any credibility in their eyes."
34,1979,GIN,"The elimination of apartheid and an end to foreign intervention in the domestic affairs of the peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America are preconditions to the establishment of true peace."
34,1979,BOL,The Andean group is confident that democratic systems of government will be established in Latin America in which the exercise of power will derive from the legitimate and free expression of the will of the people and a better situation will be created to promote measures for the political normalization of the continent and the enjoyment of human rights with the greatest respect for the principle of non-intervention.
34,1979,EGY,"At the same time we condemn equally all forms of foreign presence and intervention in Africa, regardless of their origin."
34,1979,EGY,"It also opposes with all its force foreign domination and colonialism, all forms of encroachment on sovereignty, and intervention in domestic affairs."
34,1979,EGY,Egypt opposes all forms of foreign intervention and the threat or use of force.
34,1979,CIV,"Only neutrality thus defined will protect the non-aligned countries from foreign intervention and guarantee their independence from the great Powers, without which there can be no non-alignment."
34,1979,MMR,"In principle, if the overthrow of an existing Government of a country by forces opposed to it, with the armed intervention of an outside Power, were to be condoned, the elementary rules and accepted norms of international relationships would be greatly impaired."
34,1979,PAK,"We are opposed to policies of intervention, domination, hegemony and spheres of influence."
34,1979,PAK,"Instead, IndoChina has been tormented by massive violations of human rights, by armed intervention to overthrow an established Government and install another regime, and by a flood of refugees seeking haven from terror and persecution."
34,1979,VAT,"The formal reason for my intervention today is, without any question, the special bond of co-operation that links the Apostolic See with the United Nations, as is shown by the presence of the Holy See's Permanent Observer to this Organization."
34,1979,VAT,"How grateful we are to the Lord when a direct intervention succeeds in avoiding such a conflict, as in the case of the tension that last year threatened Argentina and Chile."
34,1979,CYP,"If the foreign intervention and interference cease, Cyprus can become a happy homeland for all its citizens—Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots alike."
34,1979,MAR,"After enduring the worst kinds of exploitation and colonial rule, and with some of its southern territories still struggling under the burden of racist and colonial regimes, our African continent, with its wounds still unhealed, is once again suffering from the evils of foreign intervention and attempts to impose regional hegemony and destabilization of its countries."
34,1979,OMN,"The implementation of the Declaration would require first of all the sincere contribution of the coastal and hinterland States to translating its content into fact, It would necessitate the commitment of the States of the area to mutual respect, as well as to respect for regional sovereignty and the principles of non-intervention in internal affairs, non-resort to the use or the threat of force in international relations and compliance with the principle of the peaceful settlement of any disputes, in keeping with international law and the relevant international covenants."
34,1979,ROU,"We believe that nothing can justify recourse to force or the threat of force, in any form whatsoever, still less armed intervention in the internal affairs of other States."
34,1979,ROU,"The attempt to settle disputes by means of military intervention or by the use of force is typical of the old imperialist policy, which was based on the right of the strong against the weak, on the violation of the principles of international legality, on the defiance of the principles of justice and of the sacred rights of peoples to freedom and national independence."
34,1979,THA,"At the same time, my delegation is convinced that all States in the area have the right to exist in security and with freedom from external aggression or armed intervention."
34,1979,THA,Vietnamese armed intervention; the Government of Democratic Kampuchea was toppled and replaced by the so-called United Front for the National Salvation of Kampuchea.
34,1979,THA,"In the Joint Statement issued at Bangkok on 12 January 1979, the ASEAN Foreign Ministers strongly deplored the armed intervention against the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kampuchea and called for the immediate and total withdrawal of foreign forces from Kampuchean territory."
34,1979,THA,"The fact that the ASEAN countries chose to deplore both the Chinese incursion into Viet Nam and the Vietnamese intervention in Kampuchea fully and clearly demonstrated their earnest desire to remain neutral in the conflicts, from which position they hoped to be able to exert a stabilizing influence on the developments in the region."
34,1979,THA,"Secondly, although a country may disagree with the internal conduct of another sovereign State, that by no means gives it a justification for resorting to armed intervention against that State—an act which is in flagrant violation of the principles of independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity."
34,1979,THA,"This conviction of ours was further reinforced when over 80,000 Kampucheans came over into Thailand by land in the aftermath of Vietnamese armed intervention against Kampuchea, thus imposing an extraordinary burden on Thailand and creating grave dangers to its security and stability."
34,1979,THA,"In Kampuchea, the root-cause of the problem is the foreign armed intervention and the continued fighting there."
34,1979,IND,"If we still see recalcitrant imperialism, malevolent or defiant racism, persistent habits of intervention, manipulation, domination and even aggression, this is because there are forces trying to stem the tide of history."
34,1979,IND,Foreign intervention and foreign involvement in Indo-China continued in new forms distorting the entire situation in that strategic area.
